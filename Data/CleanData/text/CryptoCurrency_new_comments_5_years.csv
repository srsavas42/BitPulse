3,1gunax2,lxvagm6,"tldr; Assets under management for crypto investment vehicles have reached a record high of $138 billion, according to CoinShares. This surge is attributed to $2.2 billion in investments last week, driven by looser monetary policy and the Republican party's recent electoral success. The majority of investments are in U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved by the SEC, allowing both sophisticated and retail investors to invest in cryptocurrencies. Ethereum also saw significant investment, with $646 million flowing into related products.

Chainlink is going live with Swift next year so it’s 100% certain that Swift will use chainlink oracles for data. 

They still need a settlement chain but the chain in question will be anything connected to CCIP. It’s what the institution decides but with CCIP it doesn’t matter what they chose. We have already seen avax, base and eth so far as chosen chains. Specific chains will be used for different use cases according to Swift/chainlink.

In layman's terms it's GME all over again. What happens is dealers have to hedge their delta so if you have a 40 Delta option. It means they need to own 40 shares to cover that risk and this is all done electronically. If the price advances and it goes 41 42 43, they have to continually keep buying shares to keep their delta risk neutral. More people buy an options, more shares have to be bought and it's all leveraged for this very reason.

They need to make sure they can always support the debt, in all scenarios, and not over-leverage, which I am quite sure they are doing. Their leverage is quite modest, under 25%, and they are only taking new debt when the previous one settles. 2027 convertible notes are already eligible for conversion, the counters for all other notes are running as well (the share price is well above the targets). including the 2030 notes.

Saylor is simply front running the 2025 BTC bull market.

If anybody on this subreddit, or anywhere else, knew this, they wouldn't tell you.

You might as well flip a coin honestly - just either commit to investing or not, if you do invest little and often, if not stop checking charts.

Trade if you want but if you're asking randoms on Reddit what's going to happen to the [X] token price you're going to lose a lot of money - the people on this subreddit are generally extremely badly informed and also have a cult-like obsession with their favourite tokens, most of which are shit and don't do anything useful.

Nobody knows where the financial infrastructure will move, nobody knows whether bitcoin is going to be able to add a proper smart contract system, nobody knows whether BlackRock will start doing their accounting in Cardano (lol) - and for the foreseeable future everything will just track bitcoin anyway, alt coins are basically weird, gambly, leverage. If you think money's going to move away from bitcoin then the obvious choice is Ethereum or permissioned chains - Avalanche is yet another Ethereum clone with stupid subnet marketing glued on that nobody actually uses - all smart contract chains are just EVM clones and the only reason any are used is because gas is cheaper. There are 0 useful development or financial advantages to anything outside of Ethereum except hype and arbitrarily changed gas fees / tx processing speed at least for the next decade - when global financial infra has moved partially to blockchain then we can all start using fundamental analysis to figure out who's going to be the best chain - but realistically they'll just use some custom hyperledger solution anyway - why would they muck around with public nodes?",3,2024-11-18 14:21:58,1731961318.0,CryptoCurrency

The point is, a coin's inflation should either be low or zero, and there should be no way in the code to increase it, and nodes should be able to enforce the hard limit. Anything with those parameters could be money, but realistically, it won't be more than one per country, and maybe not more than one per planet.

The reality is this.  Eth isn't going anywhere.  As much as people who were late to the party want to pretend it's going to be replaced by Solana, it's not.  They are a huge ecosystem with some incredibly bright minds and in many ways are setting the precedent and trailblazing for blockchain overall.  Other chains who built their chain with advantages over eth, typically did it based on discoveries the eth research team found or shortcomings that were exposed by them choosing to build and develop.

They haven't stopped.  They will continue to remove tech debt, they will continue to research and develop, and they will continue to get better.

I say all that to say, they're here to stay.  And they have been suppressed heavily this cycle.  The whales and market makers seek out opportunities to exploit and eth is essentially being primed to look too tasty to ignore.  The shorts build, the doubt grows, and at some point it's just going to require some fire being thrown on the gunpowder for it to get legs.  And when it does, people will chase the pump...they always do.

The day after that, as rising prices further validate his intuition, he buys yet another million contracts, this time paying $1.25.

Large centralized exchanges comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, using tools like Chainalysis and CipherTrace to monitor and block 'dirty' coins linked to illegal activities. Monero, once known for its privacy, has seen its anonymity questioned, with instances of tracking by authorities and companies like Chainalysis. Despite efforts to ensure privacy, complete anonymity in cryptocurrency transactions remains elusive.

Saylor predicts Bitcoin could reach $13 million in 21 years, setting a trend for other companies to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

I used to think btc hitting a million was fantasy, but after enough deep diving into the fundamentals, it's clear as day that this will likely shoot up to 10 to 15 million within our lifetimes. People still fail to grasp the gravity of the situation. 

The bond market is stagnating because bond holders realize that the more they invest in u.s bonds the more inflation will rise, which could lead to a collapse of the U.S dollar. No one wants the dollar to disappear and combined with the stagnating returns in the bond market, there are a ridiculous number of wealthy people and institutions eyeing btc as a safer and better alternative for their returns. 

Pensions and reserves are flowing into btc as we speak. Even if btc takes 1 to 5 percent of the total amount of money invested into things, which it likely will, that will dramatically increase the price.

The only thing that makes me nervous about btc is ai and quantum computing. If that's perfected, cryptography in general will be in a World of shit, but we're a ways off from that so either way, whether it's here to stay forever or for 20 years....it'll be an amazing run.

The real question is, ""Why doesn't it pop?""

Why doesn't Bitcoin crash back to $300/each like from a few years ago?

That's everything to do with the emission schedule and the hashrate. 

Everyone wants to own as much money as possible, therefore, will want to own as much Bitcoin/gold/silver as possible. 

That makes it inherently bubbly.

The thing that stops it popping is lack of new supply extracted cheaply. 

If someone can mine Bitcoins today at $100/each, you bet that Bitcoin will dump hard. But they can't. They can hardly get some at $50k+ each. 

And it's guaranteed to get harder to get new Bitcoins in the future.

This story is repeated throughout history. Glass beads in Africa stopped being good money when Europeans mass produced glass beads. Rai stones stopped being good money when technologically advanced folks mass produced rai stones. 

Gold stayed a good money because:

Gold is an element that can't be produced and is dense enough to be in the core of the earth. Naturally, it is scarce and can't be mass produced.

Gold is impossible for humans, despite technological prowess, to debase at any significant rate. 

It has a very high stock to flow, and it has a constant difficulty adjustment.

Bitcoin is the first time we were able to replicate it digitally because Satoshi figured out how to solve the Byzantine General's Problem. 

Crypto is a winner takes most game. Most forks like BSV, BCH, etc. all bleed against Bitcoin because it's extremely insecure. They could be double spent against, easily (rented hashrate).

Bitcoin continues to win because it has the largest hashrate advantage.

It takes a true disruptor that innovates a solution to a very significant problem that can steal marketshare from Bitcoin. The only one that likely will disrupt Bitcoin is Kaspa.",2,2024-11-18 01:01:22,1731913282.0,CryptoCurrency

The sole use of the dollar as the world trade currency give it some value (but there are still fiat with more nominal value).

Real value is defined by what you are willing to consume. If someone buys a gold watch for $1000 and never expects a future profit, then the watch is worth $1000 of real value.

>I think a lot of people don't understand 

In this sub, many people confuse financial value with consumption value. Bitcoin has no consumption value - maybe as a collectible for very few rich ppl - while gold has consumption value. Bitcoin is a financial asset only for the vast majority. A lot of ppl say crypto is in a bubble because they can't see the sector producing/servicing assets backed by consumption value. That is fine.

Historically, it's only gold and silver that can withstand the test of time. Everything else sucks.

Monetary premium isn't scarcity. Monetary premiums are the excess value goods that act as money (""monetary goods"") has that is nothing to do with its consumption.

1143,1gtrvii,lxov8x0,First off I would suggest familiarising yourself with Capital gains Tax on the official government website. Up until April you get £3000 tax free and then will pay 10-20% (depending on your income) on anything other that. From April 2025 onwards the allowance halves to £1500 and the percentage will probably be higher. Not sure if they've updated the site with the latest Budget changes for 2025 yet. The good news is that you won't have to declare anything for this tax year until end of 2025. Other than that you'll probably need Kraken and link your bank account. Certain UK banks can be a problem. Depends if you're with a shit one or not :D,1,2024-11-17 19:57:06,1731895026.0,CryptoCurrency

This rise is attributed to the BONK DAO's announcement to burn 1 trillion tokens by Christmas, increasing scarcity and driving up the price. The coin's social dominance has also increased, indicating strong community interest. BONK's price is currently around $0.000050, with potential to rise to $0.000055, though overbought conditions could lead to a pullback to $0.000030.

This is possible because of Ethereums smart contract options. Tokens can be built on Ethereum using standards like ERC-20 - this is a blueprint for creating tokens. Ethereum is the operating system while meme coins or other tokens are an application running on top of it. Most new tokens prefer to use already established blockchains because building a brand new blockchain is complex and expensive and needs people to secure it",3,2024-11-17 12:31:53,1731868313.0,CryptoCurrency

If ETH fails, so do all the tokens that operate on it.  
If the token fails, ETH may or may not be affected depending on how important that token is to its ecosystem.  
If the token skyrockets in popularity and value, it would have a positive impact on the ETH ecosystem.  
But if ETH rockets, that doesn't necessarily mean every token that operates on it also rockets-- that's more dependent on that token's own value and popularity.

The average NFT transaction value also increased by 87%. This growth breaks a seven-month downturn in the NFT market, coinciding with a bullish trend in the broader crypto markets.

1539,1gtekwl,lxm2szf,"I’m bullish on Litecoin because it is fundamentally similar to Bitcoin, technically superior, widely accessible, and recognized by TradFi institutions.

If you had bought Nvidia stock at its peak in 2008, you wouldn’t have seen returns until 2018. Yet, those who consistently dollar-cost averaged, like many employees, achieved remarkable gains. Similarly, crypto is still in its early stages, with only about 5% of the world holding any form of it.

While past performance is not an indicator of future returns, an asset’s lack of performance so far doesn’t mean it won’t thrive. Litecoin is widely adopted, listed on nearly every Bitcoin exchange and service, and recognized by major financial institutions and platforms like Fidelity, Grayscale, PayPal, Venmo, MoneyGram, and Coins.ph.

Litecoin stands out as fundamentally similar to Bitcoin but technically superior in key areas:

- **Hard cap:** 84 million coins, ensuring scarcity.
- **Mining algorithm:** Scrypt instead of SHA256, enhancing miner decentralization.
- **Faster transactions:** 2.5-minute block times versus Bitcoin’s 10 minutes.
- **Efficient network performance:** 4x faster difficulty adjustments for consistency.
- **Low transaction fees:** Averaging under a penny, making it highly cost-effective.
- **Merged mining:** Combined with Dogecoin and Bellscoin, boosting miner revenue and Scrypt security.
- **Privacy features:** MWEB for optional privacy.

Considering these advantages, Litecoin’s current valuation seems significantly undervalued. Its solid fundamentals and growing adoption position it as a compelling asset in the evolving crypto landscape.",2,2024-11-17 10:37:15,1731861435.0,CryptoCurrency

I think its worth to check it out, since its very unknown project so far. 1m marketcap, so its super early to get in now. Price can be easily 10$, when things catch up. 

They are currently building their own datacenters all around the world. And already business buying the token to use the product.

1636,1gtcqod,lxl3ly5,"tldr; Bitcoin has surged over 30% since the U.S. presidential election, driven by high demand and increasing stablecoin liquidity, potentially pushing its value above $100,000. CryptoQuant analysts suggest that Bitcoin is not overvalued, supported by the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The demand for Bitcoin is growing, particularly from U.S. investors, as seen in the Coinbase Bitcoin price premium. Rising stablecoin liquidity, especially Tether (USDT), is contributing to this trend, although minor selling pressure from miners may occur.

The current exchange inflow is valued at approximately $780 million, down from previous levels, indicating that most ETH holders are refraining from selling. Strong support is noted at the $3,075 level, with a potential rally if bullish momentum continues. However, increased selling pressure could risk a dip below $3,000.

- 90% of Nano’s search traffic is directed to their homepage (screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/htwz34g.png), making them highly vulnerable to market trends. This reliance on a single entry point suggests an ineffective SEO strategy across their site.

Marketing Imbalance:

- Despite being around for a while, Nano hasn’t diversified its marketing efforts. The lack of balance here is a missed opportunity to build a more stable presence.

Blog Strategy Lacking:

- Nano has an active blog, but without a clear strategy, it doesn’t contribute meaningfully to growth. Posts lack direction, limiting their impact.

**Traffic Trends:**  
- Their website traffic has been on a steady downtrend since 2022. ([Traffic example](https://i.imgur.com/eO4z0zw.png))  
- Most of their organic traffic is branded, which aligns with their peak popularity in 2021-2022.  

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Impact of Google’s Helpful Content Update (August 2022):**  
   - This update prioritizes content that is genuinely helpful and discourages generic or low-value content. ([Read more](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update))  
   - Their blog content feels generic and AI-written, lacking authenticity, graphs, visuals, or actionable data. For example, this article could provide much more value: [Ergo vs. Other Blockchain Platforms](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/Ergo-Vs-Other-Blockchain-Platforms-What%E2%80%99s-The-Difference/).  

2. **SEO Underperformance:**  
   - Out of 108 blog articles, only 8 generate any organic traffic, with just 45 monthly visitors across the blog.  
   - Basic SEO best practices are missing:  
     - URLs with capital letters and special characters.  
     - No timestamps on articles.  
     - Missing or poorly optimized meta titles, descriptions, canonical tags, and schema.  
   - For a deeper understanding of how to improve SEO in Web3, check out our guide: [Web3 SEO Guide](https://guerrillabuzz.com/web3-seo/).  

3. **Lack of PR Activities:**  
   - They rely on earned media from time to time, but there’s no evidence of a structured PR effort.  
   - Without a dedicated PR strategy, they’re unable to capitalize on the current market momentum, unlike their performance in the 2021-2022 bull run.

**Recommendations**  

- **SEO Strategy:**  
   - Conduct a thorough SEO audit and create a clear strategy focused on generating organic traffic.  
   - Improve content quality by adding depth, visuals (e.g., graphs, charts), and real data. Content should be written to provide value, not just to check off a box.  
   - Fix technical SEO issues like:  
     - Properly formatted URLs (no capital letters or special characters).  
     - Adding canonical tags and schema.  
     - Writing meta titles/descriptions that attract clicks.  

- **Authentic Content Creation:**  
   - Focus on creating high-quality, authentic articles that solve real problems for the audience.  
   - Include examples, comparisons, and original insights to make content stand out.  

- **Invest in PR:**  
   - Hire a PR agency or build an in-house team to generate consistent coverage.  
   - Target stories that increase awareness beyond branded traffic and position Ergo as a leader in the blockchain space.

1745,1gtb73x,lxkwxjs,"### Plutus: Marketing Analysis  

**Traffic Concentration:**  
- **Branded Traffic Dominance:** 99% of their traffic is branded, with 80% going to the homepage, ~10% to product pages, and ~9% to the blog and help section.  
- **Content Focus:** Their blog is entirely focused on their brand, without any content targeting a wider audience or answering common questions potential users might have.  

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Traffic Over-Reliance:** Almost all their traffic comes from people who already know the brand. This is risky in a competitive industry, especially if the market shifts.  
2. **Content Underperformance:** Out of 86 blog pages, only 48 are indexed in search engines, and just 7 bring any traffic. For example, here’s an article that generates no visits: [https://i.imgur.com/7aTW1Qg.png](https://i.imgur.com/7aTW1Qg.png)  



**Recommendations**


1. **Strategic PR:**  
   - Instead of focusing only on branded PR (e.g., “Plutus enhances Curve Perk rewards for premium users”), they should create articles targeting specific audience problems and search terms.  
   - PR efforts should link to various sections of their site, not just the homepage. This will drive traffic to important pages like product descriptions or features.  

2. **SEO Improvements:**  
   - Conduct proper keyword research to figure out what their target audience is searching for. For example, topics like “best crypto debit cards” could bring in new users.  
   - Out of their 86 blog posts, only 7 generate traffic. They need to optimize their existing articles and create content beyond just promoting themselves.  

3. **What is YMYL (Your Money Your Life), and why does it matter?**  
   - YMYL refers to content that impacts someone’s finances, safety, or well-being—like crypto and fintech.  
   - Search engines (especially Google) are stricter with YMYL content and rank it lower unless the site proves it’s trustworthy. To fix this:  
     - Add detailed team bios with LinkedIn links on the About page.  
     - Set up Crunchbase and other profiles to showcase credibility.  
     - Blog articles should have authors with real credentials, connected via schema (structured code that search engines understand).

**Strengths:**  
- **Active in B2B:** Strong presence in conferences, regular partnerships with strategic companies, and active blog/social media showcasing these collaborations.  
- **Ecosystem Advantage:** Being on Cosmos provides a close-knit community and ecosystem support that helps with integrations and partnerships.  

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Lost Target Audience:** The focus seems to have shifted to partnerships and features, while their core target audience (developers) may feel overlooked.  
2. **Traffic Challenges:** Their website traffic is on a downtrend and appears to rely heavily on branded traffic, making them vulnerable to market fluctuations. ([Traffic example](https://imgur.com/a/420xh3L))  
3. **Limited Reach Beyond Ecosystem:** While Cosmos offers strong internal support, they haven’t expanded much beyond this ecosystem, limiting their exposure to new audiences.  

**Recommendations**  

- **Focus on Technical Content:**  
   - Publish **authentic technical articles** written by developers for developers.  
   - Showcase real-world use cases by having devs share their experiences building on Secret Network—what they built, how they did it, and the challenges they overcame.  
   - This approach will provide real value to their audience and help establish trust and credibility in the dev community.

- **Diversify Target Audience:**  
   - **Expand beyond blockchain devs:** Secret Network also supports Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript developers.  
   - Allocate resources (time, budget, and PR) to target these Web2 developers through meetups, hackathons, and tailored content.  

- **Shift Spending from Blockchain-Only Events:**  
   - While blockchain conferences are great, they should invest in events, PR, and content targeted at Web2 developers.  
   - For example: Sponsor Rust or TypeScript developer events, create educational materials on how to build with Secret Network, or host hackathons that emphasize easy onboarding for non-blockchain developers.  

**Why These Changes Matter:**  

- **Addressing Traffic Decline:** By targeting technical audiences with valuable, non-branded content, they can drive organic traffic and reduce dependence on market trends.  
- **Developer-Centric Growth:** Secret Network is in a position to attract and onboard a broader developer base, which will drive long-term adoption.

So the existing shareholders have gone from having 100% of a $30B company to 93.3% of a $105B company, which is $32.7B. The existing shareholders gain $2.7B from the new equity that was raised.

I don't expect any institution to advocate for BTC (except Microstrategy, obviously), but I do expect them to advocate in their own interests, and BTC is now part of those interests. We can all look at the historical data, but none of it represents the circumstances we find ourselves in now. Historical data doesn't have Microstrategy and their 21:21 plan, it doesn't have ETFs, it doesn't have a fraction of the nuance we now find in BTC; the landscape is very different now than it was in previous runs. I'm not saying it won't play out exactly how it has historically, but I think there is a 'chance' we see something different, and relying on data from previous cycles that is not representative of the current situation seems a little too reductionist for me. 

None of us can predict the price, regardless of how many people are happy to speculate about it.

Not everyone will succeed because they likely will make inefficient decisions based on which coins they purchased. Some people will triple their money, some will fare even a little better, some will be ± 25% from where they started, and lots more will watch the entire bull run go by because they're waiting for the perfect price (i.e. Solana @ $1,000) and refuse to sell for anything less.

2069,1gt0v5i,lxiq6nr,"Wallstreet Bets Style Investment Thesis to Follow for Ethereum and some discussion of other alts

I have over the past 3 years of careful study of crypto markets gained enough conviction for a massive play. I’ve been liquidating longterm stock gains as they reach stretched valuations all year. I am now sitting on a mound of cash (by my standards anyway). I’ll be looking to purchase a total of $160,000 worth of Ethereum exposure when all said and done. Below I have included the basic tenants of my thesis and why now is the timing I have chosen (hint… it’s all related to ETH/BTC).

Thesis tenants:

1. The market cycle top will be somewhere around Q4 2025 (post-halving year)-Q1 2026 as it has been in past cycles.
2. As QE approaches and retail investors return, altcoins will begin to outperform bitcoin as a whole market again (ALTSEASON).
3. Ethereum will continue to exist through this whole cycle (at least next 4 years).
4. ETH/BTC will top somewhere around 0.08-0.1 as it did last cycle.

IF all these tenants hold true, THEN Ethereum should hit a market cycle high somewhere around $10,000.

All this being said, I know there are definitely alt coins that will yield higher returns over the next year than Ethereum. The reasons I am interested in Ethereum over them are:

1. I do not feel confident being able to choose a small market cap alt that is not battle tested through multiple cycles.
2. Due to the size of this bet for me, I am looking for relatively low risk (at least in comparison to the rest of the altcoin market).
3. I can buy Ethereum in leveraged ETFs which I deem the safest way for me personally to take on leverage in the crypto market.


I believe that we are seeing amazing discounts in ETH/BTC right now and that it is going to set up quite a nice bull run for ETH once ETH/BTC does bottom (I think in next quarter or so at longest). There is a reason I bought over 50k of ethereum exposure last week alone😳. 


I have done a ton of work to be ready for this move in my person finances. This includes my crypto YouTube channel I started a bit ago detailing more technical analysis and trendlines (although not my favorite tool). The username is @CryptoCrayfish3 and feel free to dm or drop a comment there or here.

2105,1gt0nka,lxk13f7,"So here is my thought on just this weekend's price action. 

Last week, Bitcoin went on a massive run up to 93K and basically all the attention was on Bitcoin with huge volume going into Bitcoin.  Naturally, alts started to bleed against Bitcoin all week long.  And finally, with the weekend, Bitcoin's volume started to go down and its volatility went down.  All the old-time traders know that this is the condition when alts run.  And alts have been running this weekend.  

But there was a twist. 

Usually, when something like this happens, ETH runs first, and then the big caps, then the mid caps, and then the small caps, etc.  But I think retailer traders saw through this pattern and the whales reversed it.  That is, notice that pretty much all the alts EXCEPT for the three biggest market cap ones (ETH, SOL, BNB) ran first.  And then, now SOL is running so what is left is ETH and BNB.  I think the whales conspired to reverse the order so people who parked into ETH after Friday afternoon got stuck holding their dicks while everything else mooned. 

Also, the nature of this weekend run. 

Notice that not everything is running concurrently.  First, it was like ADA and the likes.  Then, XRP, XLM.  And now SOL.  And while one is running the others are stale.  This is the sign of there not being enough capital to go through all the alts concurrently.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who previously criticized crypto as ""worthless"" and ""fraudulent,"" expressed an openness to reconsider its role in the economy. This shift comes as the bitcoin price nears $100,000, driven by Donald Trump's presidential victory and expectations of relaxed U.S. crypto regulations. Trump's administration, featuring pro-crypto advisors, may further boost bitcoin's appeal as a strategic asset.

While in the bathroom, Leibov was confronted by masked individuals who demanded a 500,000 USDT transfer, threatening violence. He negotiated the amount down to 250,000 USDT. After the robbers fled, Leibov reported the crime to the police. This incident highlights the growing trend of physical assaults on crypto holders.

I was watching Polymarket during the fight, and even after the first round you could have still put money on Paul and made a decent payout. Which seems insane because within 30 seconds it was absolutely clear Tyson was way too slow and had zero chance of winning.

2460,1gsrkj1,lxglksa,"tldr; Uruguay has passed a law regulating cryptocurrency, signed by President Luis Lacalle Pou, which gives the Central Bank authority over virtual assets and service providers. This move positions Uruguay as a potential leader in crypto regulation in Latin America, given its stable democracy and economy. The law aims to legitimize and increase confidence in virtual assets, potentially attracting investors. While crypto is not yet widely adopted in Uruguay, the regulation could foster business development. The law is seen as a positive step, with hopes for clear regulations from the Central Bank.

Second one was: buy alts that newly came out after the last bullrun. They have fresh hype. If you look at Dot, Algo, Ada, Link, or any of the “good alts” that’re more than just memecoins, their value is nothing compared to what it once was, while other coins released later built on new and improved ideas have gained value much faster.

Sol has the reputation of “ETH killer”. Whether it’s true or not, it has certainly performed a ton better than ETH; when stuff was dumping ETH dumped as hard, but when pumping it pumped harder than ETH. Even now you can see the difference.

SUI had good marketing behind it and some interesting technology, and since it is also quite new, it has pumped that much harder.

Third lesson is dump a tiny bit after every significant pump. Youll miss out on a bit of profit along the way but youll be much more sorry than if you hadnt sold anything and everything crashes hard.",57,2024-11-16 08:29:19,1731767359.0,CryptoCurrency

Our time-tested principles emphasize that long-term investing is essential and reacting to short-term trends can be costly for one's portfolio. While we don't currently offer cryptocurrencies as an investment option, we acknowledge the impact they're making in the investing world. As cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream, we'll continue to monitor their development and discern the best path forward for our investors.

2832,1gsgity,lxe7rq3,"tldr; Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, has criticized Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. SEC, labeling him ""evil"" for allegedly harming the cryptocurrency industry. Winklevoss accuses Gensler of using a political agenda to damage the industry, resulting in job losses and financial setbacks. He urges organizations to avoid collaborating with Gensler, claiming his actions are deliberate rather than mistaken. Winklevoss argues that Gensler's regulatory approach has negatively impacted the crypto space and calls for resistance against such government actions.

2880,1gsg9p2,lxje00g,"Okay, well in that case, consider how you would define fittest.  Or even survival for that matter.  In the context of evolution, the individual doesn't matter much so when you're talking about survival, what you might be referring to is the endurance of a species without major adaptive divergence.  The way the form of a crocodile has endured for millions of years without change.  But this same definition of a species enduring without change would apply to cave ecosystems that have been isolated from the outside world for millions of years.  Is a blind cave fish the ""fittest"" even if the slightest change in temperature or air quality would kill it?

Evolution doesn't prize fittness or surivival.  It's an extremely chaotic approach that fills every possible niche as fast as it can and the species that endure do so for a variety of reasons, but there's not a lot of evidence that suggests that that endurance is a positive thing.  Is the crocodilles' form better because it endured or is the crabs' because it keeps showing up as the answer to a lot of different evolutionary questions?  Some of the most successful branches on the tree of life are populated by creatures that barely look anything like what they did a few million years ago.

This is the problem with the ""survival of the fittest"" concept as an understanding of evolution or metaphor for other systems.  It's a fundamental misconception and usually, when it comes up, it is because somebody is justifying something horrible like social darwinism or eugenics.  We'd probably all be smarter if we let it go.

It's also worth noting that Darwin never said it.  His quote was ""It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.""  The fittest quote came from an English philospher who was applying Darwin to sociology.",2,2024-11-16 21:14:50,1731813290.0,CryptoCurrency

Saylor argues that Bitcoin could serve as a secure, high-return reserve asset, similar to historical investments in gold and oil.

Is it too late to buy in at current levels? *No.. but YOU take the time to weigh the risk/reward. No one can advise you on how much risk you’re able to tolerate . 

1. Do not dump your life saving into any investment because it happens to be trending on TikTok. Just assume all price predictions are wrong until they come to fruition. 

2. Set a plan based on realistic expectations. The likelihood that Bitcoin will 100x is low but greater than 0%. Same for Bitcoin dropping to $0. 

3. You don’t need $90k to invest in Bitcoin. Invest what u can afford to lose. You should also factor into your plan (2) that it may take a couple of years to reach your desired goals. 

Risk and uncertainty: in my opinion, Bitcoin’s risk profile dropped exponentially once the spot ETF requests were approved by the DC High Court back in January.  The only other risks that I see (albeit low probability) is if the new administration is unable to implement the plan to make Bitcoin a reserve asset, which I’m assuming other governments, state pensions, high net worth investors etc are keeping a close eye on. There’s going to be a tipping point in the very near future where the 21M (minus a few million that have been lost or locked away forever) runs out and the people that are hodling will continue hodling! 🚀

A. Their jaded from previous losses and if they never invested, they probably know people who got burned.

B. The economy is rough, so if people buy in, they'll defer to safer investments like btc, eth, or sol.

C. Trump and Musk. It's stupid, I know but there's a decent chunk of people who gag at the thought of crypto because they associate it with these guys. Anecdotal but I spoke with this young woman the other day who was super thankful she never invested in crypto (weird, I know).

The inflows are also seen as part of a broader interest in digital assets beyond Bitcoin, with Ethereum being the only other crypto asset with an approved spot ETF.

Web3 projects, especially decentralized exchanges and lending platforms, are frequent targets. Attackers use spoofed addresses and malicious links to deceive users into granting wallet permissions, leading to significant financial losses. Certik highlights the importance of user vigilance and recommends using tools like Etherscan to revoke suspicious wallet approvals. The Ethereum and Solana ecosystems are particularly affected, with scams often involving fake phishing wallets.

The survey indicates a growing interest in blockchain projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with 79% planning to increase crypto investments in the next year.

Despite some analysts' concerns about a potential drop, Saylor remains optimistic about Bitcoin's upward trajectory. He also discussed the potential impact of SEC Chair Gary Gensler's resignation, which he believes could lead to more favorable Bitcoin regulations. Additionally, Saylor highlighted the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill, which aims for the U.S. to accumulate 1 million Bitcoin, potentially delivering significant economic benefits.

Interoperable standards like ERC-721 and ERC-20 already exist, and projects like Enjin and Gala Games are actively working on creating cross-game ecosystems.

Concerns about centralization versus decentralization can be addressed with hybrid models, offering token benefits while retaining centralized structures for stability.

The argument that players don’t care overlooks the potential appeal for dedicated gamers and collectors who value persistent assets. I, personally , care , and the fact such platforms already exist off-chain prove there is a strong interest in such solutions. 

Existing off-chain examples like the Steam Marketplace and in-game currencies like V-Bucks show a demand for digital economies, and player-created trade hubs in No Man’s Sky prove that such systems can thrive organically

Nothing, they make the game and can do what they want. A more useful question is what specifically will they gain by putting their things on a blockchain? If they don't anticipate a gain they have very little reason to do it. Would it be cheaper? Would it be faster? Would it let them do something they want to do but currently can't? 

When assessing design choices it isn't just about whether you can use a tool, but which tool is actually better for your purpose.

Now imagine the difficulty of personally delivering them 1 billion usd worth of gold and bitcoin. No third parties, you must deliver it personally. That's the breakthrough.

Bitcoin is a paradigm shift in our understanding of money. The problem is, human psychology is fundamentally incompatible with paradigm shifts. People always prefer old tech they are familiar with rather than new tech with a steep learning curve. We are creatures of habit and prone to anxiety and fear. Every single technology gets adopted in a similar curve and pattern because the masses need all the supporting infrastructure in place before they're ready to join the innovators. 

Paradigm shifts are never embraced immediately and will always be punctuated by loud people screaming the rules of the last paradigm, saying this won't work.

Bitcoin is taking a long time to adopt because of risk. Adopting the internet was easy. There was extremely low risk for trying out new apps and new messaging systems. Now you have to pony up money to try the new thing.

Imagine the invention of electricity. There were no electricians. No wire manufacturers with good insulation. No youtube to learn how to wire your house. Using it was extremely risky and many houses caught fire in the early days. It took a long time between Edison and mass adoption.

Money has had very obvious properties throughout the ages. Bitcoin is the strongest expression of these properties. It is the hardest money we've ever known and the hardest money always wins.

The Dutch would have wished they loaded up on the French currency. The French would have wished they'd loaded up on the British  currency. The British the US. The US, bitcoin.

You really have to open up your mind to wat bigger concepts to understand this thing. The dawn of software and apps have made us believe that all technological advancements are advancements in ease of use and convenience. Now we have something fundamentally different that requires you to learn a lot of new things and feels clunky and unintuitive.

So that's good, now you're finally truly curious, you'll be able to be a real, actual skeptic soon!

I'll give one tidbit - first off, Bitcoin is unchangeable due to the decentralized proof-of-work mining. It has an eventual fixed supply (there is a future point when no more will be created) and this is an immutable fact without spending billions and billions of dollars to set up enough miners to control a majority of the network. Studies have shown that you would have to spend more money than you'd gain by doing this - this as well as not being under centralized control which would make it an easier target for hackers makes the Bitcoin network secure. (Note this security doesn't save anyone from themselves if they fall for a scam).

So that's one of the most important aspects to understand: you have this asset with fixed emission and eventually fixed supply THAT IS NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANY CENTRAL ENTITY and to make it better, IT'S PURELY DIGITAL  making it easier to integrate into our digital lives than certificates of gold ownership or some other shit like that.

Have you ever been pissed at the feds for printing more money and fucking us all up with more inflation? That is but one example of something that Bitcoin fixes. The way Bitcoin was designed makes it be like a rare commodity like gold that can be used as a store of value, but anyone can just on-ramp onto the network and use it without permission. Just need a wallet and to keep your cryptography private key safe (which is what is used to have control of a wallet). Even better, if you own Bitcoin and if your private key is safe, you are literally in possession of that commodity as opposed to gold where you go to an exchange, you ask for permission, you send them your money and trust them with it, then you ask them to pretty please buy gold for me, then they respond and say ""Ok! We bought gold for you!"" and you just have to trust that it's true. With Bitcoin, you can truly possess it if you want. If you buy it on a centralized exchange, you're free to send it to your own wallet that you control, and from that point, my man, you are your own bank and there's a whole other world called ""decentralized finance"" aka DeFi that you can take a journey into.",1,2024-11-15 07:29:51,1731677391.0,CryptoCurrency

3648,1grvnsn,lx9o6k0,"In the future, Bitcoin will be the stable reserve asset like how gold is a stable hedge against fiat currency. It will be the dominant crypto currency among many others. For example gov'ts will likely come up with their own digital currencies that will be backed by Bitcoin, similar to how paper money USED to be backed by gold reserves. This stabilizes the coins as they are tethered to something tangible.

Bitcoin is a deflationary asset as it's limited to 21 million coins (each divisible by 100,000,000, each unit being a Satoshi.

I've lived pre-internet, Web 1.0 (static web pages, basic search), Web 2.0 (social media, centralized data) and we will eventually convert fully to Web 3.0 (we aren't there yet). This is characterized by a completely decentralized internet. Instead of a few companies like Google and Facebook holding everyone's data (and selling it for marketing purposes), individuals will own and control their own data on the blockchain.

The biggest investment firms are now investing in Bitcoin because they see how it's deflationary (limited to 21million while paper currency just keeps getting printed at an accelerated rate making it more and more worthless as inflation will increase for an increase in supply). Once corporations discover the value in this, they'll start investing billions of dollars which will in turn cause the price of BTC to skyrocket.

Bitcoin will likely reach $10M for a single BTC once all coins have been mined.

Also keep in mind in Web 3.0 it will dominated by a new technology: artificial intelligence.

This is a really good introductory video from someone with a background in computer science. He mentions how prior to the internet, skeptics raised similar concerns. But could any one entity have prevented the internet? Not by it's decentralized nature which takes power away from the few and gives it back to the people.

3652,1grvnsn,lx9xvr6,"Look historically.

People used all sorts of things as money. 

Glass beads, shells, and rai stones.

The reason they all fail is that eventually, society gets too technologically advanced and floods the market with mass-manufactured glass beads, shells, and rai stones.

The only exceptions are two metals.

Silver, and gold. 

Gold is a cosmic coincidence. Gold is dense, so most of it is in the earth's core. The small amount at the surface was seeded from asteroids.

Gold is therefore impossible to flood the market with. It actually gets a bit more difficult when you exhaust the easier to find stuff. 

Humans mine about 2% of the gold supply every year. 

Bitcoin replicates that. It is actually even more difficult to flood the market with Bitcoins than it is with gold.

If gold became worth $ 1 million /oz, we'd be extracting it from the sea. New supply hits the market. 

Bitcoin is even more supply inelastic. There is no way to change the fact that only 3.125 Bitcoins come out as the mining reward. Even if every person on Earth had 100 ASIC Bitcoin miners, it'll still be the same amount. 

That fact makes Bitcoin more supply inelastic than gold. It means that when the price goes parabolic, it DOESN'T crash back down as far as you'd expect because the cost basis goes up so fast.

The ""unforgeable costliness"" means there's no one, not the miners nor the holders, willing to dump one on the market for what it used to be. 

Bitcoin also has a supply-shock event programmed into it. The rules of Bitcoin can't be changed unless everyone who runs a node (which is random and global) agrees to change it. 

The supply shock is similar to how egg prices went crazy during avian flu, not that long ago. Or how used cars got very expensive when we had a chip shortage for new cars. 

Prices for eggs came back down when more chickens (thus more eggs) came onto the market. But this doesn't apply for Bitcoin. Bitcoin's new supply NEVER returns to old highs. It only gets lower.

The demand for Bitcoin comes from the fact that your governments borrow money that doesn't exist, and corporations and households are borrowing money that doesn't exist to buy things. This effectively ""prints"" money into existence. 

In simpler terms, it is as if the globe was run by monarchs who decide that they should melt everyone's gold coins and add some copper/tin to it at an ever increasing rate. 

Scarce things that you can't make more of, including land, go up because the dollar/yuan/euro/yen goes down. The scarcer, the more affected.

3653,1grvnsn,lx9y9wh,"Bitcoin exhibits characteristics often criticized as being pyramid-like for several reasons:

1. **Social pressure and stigmatization:** Those who hold onto their Bitcoin investments are praised as ""diamond hands,"" while those who sell are often labeled ""paper hands"" and ostracized within the community. This reinforces a culture of holding, regardless of market conditions.
2. **Tax implications and risk:** Profits from selling Bitcoin can be taxed at rates as high as 40%, while losses are borne solely by the individual, with limited tax relief. This asymmetry can deter people from selling and realizing gains.
3. **Market dynamics and potential pitfalls:** New buyers are often accused of buying at inflated prices driven by FOMO (fear of missing out). Meanwhile, long-time holders may contribute to the perception of scarcity to sustain higher prices. When the market corrects, those left holding are often referred to as ""bag holders,"" enduring significant losses as the asset's value plummets.

This combination of social pressure, financial risk, and speculative dynamics raises concerns about the sustainability of Bitcoin's investment culture.

The value of Bitcoin is often tied to the very currencies it claims to replace, such as the US Dollar or the Euro. This creates a paradox:

* Bitcoin's worth is typically expressed in terms of fiat currencies (e.g., ""$30,000 per Bitcoin""), which means its perceived value depends on the strength and stability of those currencies.
* If fiat currencies were to lose value or collapse, it could undermine Bitcoin's pricing reference, raising questions about how its value would be determined in such a scenario.

As OP seems interested in KAS as an investment, I will give some insight.

KASpa is a very young project, it could cease to exist next year or get to the top 10 regardless of the tech. What makes Kaspa rather special is that it's proof of work. That is, like for Bitcoin, miners got to invest and deploy expensive hardware to maintain the network and grab their due fees. So a thing to watch for is the harsh rate. A continuous growth is a good indication that the value of its token/currency is likely to increase. As for other indicators, well you do your own research. 

If you are not diversifying, grabbing a hefty bag would be pretty risky. High risk high reward of course, that would simply depend on your taste for it.

Another thing about Kaspa, I have not read the details yet but it seems like some significant hash power is going towards it or Bitcoin depending on market factors. That would explain why it pumps when Bitcoin dumps in value and vice versa.",4,2024-11-15 07:01:00,1731675660.0,CryptoCurrency

The BITCOIN Act of 2024, introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, does not propose the sale of the United States' gold reserves. Instead, it suggests revaluing the gold held by the Federal Reserve to help fund the acquisition of Bitcoin for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. 

Kitco

Key Points:

Revaluation of Gold: The act recommends adjusting the value of the gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve to reflect current market prices. This revaluation would increase the nominal value of these assets without necessitating their sale. 

Kitco

Funding Mechanism: By revaluing the gold, the Federal Reserve would issue new gold certificates to the Treasury, representing the updated value. The difference between the old and new certificate values would be remitted to the Treasury, providing funds to support the Bitcoin Purchase Program outlined in the act. 

Kitco

This initiative aims to combat inflation and diversify investments beyond traditional assets. The bill, sponsored by Republican state Rep. Mike Cabell, is part of a broader movement to recognize bitcoin as a store of value. If passed, Pennsylvania would be the first state to hold bitcoin directly on its balance sheet, potentially influencing other states to adopt similar measures.

Also some moves around eg reduced inflation etc (though it remains to be seen how those play out from a tokenomics perspective ). Equally some pretty interesting and credible additions of late such as Mythical Games (MYTH), and PEAQ (DePIN ecosystem)

Unfortunately it can also be quite an insular and inwards-facing ecosystem and community, which I suspect might be innately limiting to some extent. I wonder if it's maybe displaying a variation on Conway's Law where comms of an entity reflect the structure - but either way, it's quite self-referential, and there is a language and awareness gap to the outside world. In turn, that makes for a steeper than expected learning curve for newcomers.

I still hold DOT, and a few ecosystem tokens. They've all performed poorly compared to broader market over the last year. That said, I don't feel too concerned / expect some uptick at some point. I might feel more strongly if the ecosystem was my main bag, but (fortunately) it fell/falls into the category of 'interesting / let's see'.",18,2024-11-15 01:01:07,1731654067.0,CryptoCurrency

Same thing with Ethereum late last year, early this year.. Solana was the one getting all the attention and people were saying Eth sucked. But as soon as Eth pumped people are believers again.

Honestly, the whole industry is still mostly bullshit. All these chains with all these various functions and for what? So we can have a dog with a hat on? 
It’s all noise. Smart contracts are great but how many real uses are there.

Polymarket is a good one.
I like the sounds of something like Origin Trail which may replace GitHub one day.

There are good projects but they get way less love than a squirrel named pnut.

The platform, ie the layer 1 or whatever is largely irrelevant beyond making it easy to develop projects. 
We don’t need a hundred different layer 1s. 
But it’s a natural part of a free market.

What coding languages are most popular?
HTML? CSS? C#? JavaScript? Python?

There are hundreds of them and some of them are just more adopted because they are easier or more functional.
Python is a great example. It’s just simple to learn.

4121,1grko67,lx84q39,">1, DOT was a layer 0.

Ppl underestimate the curse of being a ""layer 0"" token. ETH is slowly walking into this problem.

DOT is NOT abandoned but it has a serious curse from it being a ""layer 0"" token.

Let me describe this curse.

1. DOT has no users. Its users are supposed to be on its parachains. But if your early parachains fuck up, then you have no ecosystem of users. Now if you have no users, then if old parachains die, new devs don't want to start new parachains to replace them if they can't find users in DOT. I saw it all play out exactly on DOT. A lot of fuck ups happened on early parachains. Then some parachains decided to become ETH L2s instead and fucked off.
2. DOT has no users and doesn't earn much real revenue, but it needs liquidity to fund ""public goods"" development. So, it borrowed Cosmos Hub's model of high inflation. It gives you high staking rewards from inflation. But when people cash out of those staking rewards, the price crashes because there is no real demand for DOT besides staking more Ponzi rewards.
3. Now problem 2 is compounded with ppl thinking this inflation is meant to sustainably retire ppl's lives off. So ppl just regularly dump DOT inflation to pay life expenses. Atom has the same problem. The price can't go up if passive stakers are leeching off secondary buyers liquidity in perpetuity to retire on.

Every chain trying to make a minimal base layer seems to suffer from this problem. Celestia is partially hanging on because the VCs are holding most of the inflationary rewards/unlocks and are circle-jerking themselves from crashing the price.

AVAX is partially escaping this problem because it has a C-Chain. But if activity moves off to its subnets, similar dynamics would end up playing out.

And ETH has a main net.

But it seems layer 0 tokens with minimal base layer are all fucked, e.g. DOT, Atom, Celestia, etc. There are too many incentives for independent devs teams building up on higher layers to spin up 1 gorillion different tokens to fragment attention and fund copy-and-paste protocols.

Layer 0 is a good idea if you can get a lot of profitable chains operating on you. But don't kid yourself. Most chain devs rely on selling their tokens to keep lights on - never mind profitability. That is where the equation breaks. Layer 0 is a business servicing a bunch of broke businesses that can't turn themselves profitable. Broke ppl can't make your business thrive.",14,2024-11-15 00:51:32,1731653492.0,CryptoCurrency

Chainlink was built on eth because it was the first smart contract platform. Chainlink is now chain agnostic and can deploy services on any chain, public or private.

SWIFT (11,000 banks) DTCC, Euroclear, Clearstream (all the largest banking/securities institutions) are all interested in CCIP, which connects their chains and provides data for the RWAs through chainlink oracles. CCIP is a separate network from eth and uses LINK as gas. 

None of these institutions that deploy their funds are working directly with Ethereum.

Dogecoin just trades like an Altcoin in the top 10, as it is supposed to.

the scam tokens are getting pumped by their scammer-developers.

Nothing out of the usual. 

How would you convince your victims that you are not a scam, if you did not pump your own token at the beginning of the run? Can't cause fomo in your victims if you don't fake interest in your scam-project.

FBI has already uncovered how they do it and all the scammers that have not yet been indicted, eventually will. 

Juts look at Saitama Inu, which dropped to virtually zero when the FBI uncovered that they artificially pumped their own coin using illegal practices. Come first signs of an alt-run... BIG spike upwards, because scammers simply can't stop scamming. 

As long as the crypto community tells new traders that ""meme coins go up"", scammers will take those new traders money. 

The only way to change that is to educate new investors about these scams without falling into the meme-thinking of ""it's meme coins"".  

The Bitcoin Meme of it being the only coin and everything else being trash is just as much a made up coping mechanism as ""buy and hodl"" and ""to the moon"". Neither of those memes will help anyone....

Which is why the dogecoin community is making fun of such behavior, but since it has the reputation of ""using memes to express honest and deeply held beliefs"", instead of just ""making fun"", most of the people do not realize this.

Apparently it is time to let go of your old mindset (man). Forget about the past. Imagine a new and more glorious future. And buy bitcoin.



This is a serious struggle for normies like me. Bitcoin is still not a proper currency — try using it to buy a coffee or pay your taxes almost anywhere in the world. It doesn’t pay a yield or a dividend or provide a claim to anything other than itself. The ecosystem around it is peppered with wholesome, sensible people but dominated by cranks and grifters, especially as you look past bitcoin and into the vast universe of smaller tokens and coins. 



But even I have to admit that the rally since the re-election of Donald Trump as US president is something special — a big bang moment that is impossible to ignore. The price has vaulted over $90,000 for the first time, marking a rise of over 34 per cent since election day, which, as a reminder, was just last week. A target of $100,000 by the end of this year is not outlandish. What a time to be alive and what a payday for bitcoin holders.



Analysts at Bernstein are not holding back. “Welcome to the crypto bull market,” they wrote in a note on Monday. “Buy everything you can . . . We recommend investors who have so far remained shy of any crypto exposure due to regulatory concerns ‘invert their mental model’.”



Think of the volatility that speculating on crypto injects into a portfolio, cautions UBS. “We are sceptical that crypto assets can make significant inroads in meaningful and disruptive real-world use cases,” it adds.



Any effort to come up with a macroeconomic rationale for the price of crypto is also a path to madness. But let’s do what Bernstein suggests and think differently. This rally is about two powerful forces: vibes and vision. 



Vibes have always accounted for a good portion of the ups and downs in crypto. In this case, Trump surrounded himself during the election campaign with crypto true believers. He attended the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, described by Bloomberg as a “MAGA-fied crypto lovefest”. 



Along with his sons, he backed a new crypto venture called World Liberty Financial. Elon Musk, high priest of crypto, was one of his biggest backers. The token Musk frequently boosts, Dogecoin, or Doge for short, has gained 145 per cent since election day. Musk has been chosen to lead a “department of government efficiency”, or Doge for short.



All of this and more points to a new administration that is crypto friendly and in no mood to regulate it out of existence. The vibes are good. “People are going crazy,” said Ilan Solot at brokerage Marex.



The vibe shift means that even conservative investors are increasingly willing to give crypto a chance. “This is a global portfolio rebalancing,” Solot said.



Farnborough-based pensions consultant Cartwright says that even before the US election, it advised the first ever UK pension scheme — a £50mn defined-benefit company scheme of the type that would typically rely heavily on boring old government bonds — to put 3 per cent of its portfolio directly in to bitcoin.



“Pensions and institutional investors have got loads of different asset classes,” said Sam Roberts, a director at Cartwright. “We’re saying bitcoin should be on the list.” The unnamed pension scheme he advised bought bitcoin in October and has scooped up enormous winnings since.



The broader vision is that Trump 2.0 could treat crypto not just as a speculative wheeze but as a strategic imperative. Robert F Kennedy Jr, once a rival and now a potential pick for high office, spoke at length at that Nashville conference about the need to build up national reserves of bitcoin, on a scale that rivals gold reserves. “It was a mind-blowing speech. He had really done his research,” said Richard Byworth at Swiss financial group Syz Capital. This plan could potentially start with declining to sell crypto assets seized by the federal government over the years but later expand, Kennedy said, to buying hundreds of bitcoin every day. It may be a struggle to take literally someone who opposes vaccines and wants to remove fluoride from the water system, but again: new thinking. 



Byworth reckons some of the frenzied bitcoin buying in recent days is the work of other nation states around the world keen to get in before Uncle Sam starts buying. Whether this vision comes to fruition or not, “they are adding bitcoin as if this is on the cards”, he said.



Those of us still waiting for a clean articulation of what bitcoin is will remain frustrated. But it’s getting harder every day to fight against the crypto revolution.",59,2024-11-13 17:39:14,1731541154.0,CryptoCurrency

Their recent 'ecosystem' theory for crypto seems also confusing and faulty, which would make even Kamala Harris' sales of donated xrp a securities (investment contract) sales.

Despite Gary Gensler's claim of regulatory clarity, the SEC is just creating confusion in the crypto industry when other countries have shown a clear way of legal compliance for crypto.

Stark argues that the SEC should stop its crypto crackdown and leave regulation to other agencies, as public sentiment favors cryptocurrency. He suggests that Gensler's approach is overly aggressive and predicts a pause in SEC crypto regulation. Stark's comments come amid speculation that Donald Trump's team is considering replacements for Gensler, with names like Dan Gallagher, Paul Atkins, and Mark Uyeda being mentioned as potential successors.

Binance experienced the most liquidations, followed by OKX and Bybit. After peaking at $93,400, Bitcoin corrected to $92,462, marking a 5.5% increase in 24 hours and 24% over the week. Analysts predict Bitcoin could exceed $100,000, with some forecasting a rise to $130,000.

Unless both of these conditions are met, the likelihood of recovering your funds is slim.

What you are seeing is basically the email title, you can say and write anything there. Lots of fake email use this because it's open text

The trader initially purchased approximately 19.4 million PNUT tokens for 8 Solana (SOL), equivalent to about $1,392. As the price of PNUT rose, they sold their holdings for only 4.09 SOL, receiving $711 and incurring a $681 loss. PNUT's market cap later skyrocketed, making the trader's original tokens worth $24.69 million. This highlights the volatile nature of the crypto market and meme coins.

For those not from the UK most people will be doing this is because the UK government are starting to hammer capital gains taxes, which is an issue for those with the best performing asset of the past decade and a half. 

Retail investors have a tax efficient investment account called an ISA.. Anything held within it is shielded from capital gains tax. It would be ideal if Bitcoin trades/purchases/ sales were exempt from taxation or if there was at least Bitcoin ETFs however the UK have blocked ETFs.  So one workaround is simply to buy shares in MicroStrategy.

This warning comes as crypto mining continues to expand in Russia, leveraging cheap power resources.

6183,1gq043v,lwu7tqx,"tldr; Italy's government is considering reducing its proposed tax hike on crypto trades from 42% to 28%. This change is part of an effort to support the country's digital asset sector and comes after concerns that a higher tax rate could harm Italy's competitiveness. Currently, crypto transactions in Italy are taxed at 26%. The proposed reduction aims to balance public revenue needs with industry growth. Additionally, there are suggestions to eliminate the tax hike for gains under €2,000 to encourage local participation in cryptocurrency.

Fidelity's FETH led with $115.5 million, followed by BlackRock's ETHA with $101.1 million. Grayscale's Ethereum Mini Trust also saw substantial inflows. The surge in Ethereum ETFs post-US election results is attributed to increasing institutional adoption, such as the Michigan Retirement System's recent $11 million investment in Grayscale Ethereum ETFs.

The surge coincides with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high and speculation that Ripple's price could reach $2 by the end of 2024. Rumors of a meeting between Ripple's CEO and Donald Trump regarding crypto regulations may have also contributed to the price increase.

**SEC Lawsuit: XRP is Not A Security Remains the Law of the Land**  
On August 7, the Judge issued a remedies order requiring Ripple to pay $125 million for certain historic unregistered sales of XRP to sophisticated third-party institutions. The amount is significantly lower than the unprecedented $2 billion in fines and penalties that the SEC had requested. There were no findings or allegations of fraud or recklessness against Ripple, or findings that anyone suffered any financial harm.



* **Native Smart Contract Features**: The main pathway for adding programmability to the XRPL is through the amendment process, which requires over 80% of validators to agree. Features added through this process are integrated natively into the entire network, ensuring the security, performance, and stability of the overall network. 
* **The XRPL EVM Sidechain**: This sidechain allows developers to deploy smart contracts quickly without the need for network-wide agreement. This development is already in progress, led by partner Peersyst, and will use [Axelar](https://ripple.com/insights/xrpl-evm-sidechain-enhancing-interoperability-with-axelar-bridge/) as the bridge to enable cross-chain transitions with the XRPL mainnet and over 55 blockchains.",5,2024-11-12 23:14:29,1731474869.0,CryptoCurrency

6776,1gpg1ut,lwxtxbo,"ETFs will contribute to price increases in BTC and ETH. The psychological wealth effect doesn't change. Will institutional investors who hold the ETFs rotate out of BTC and ETH into altcoins? Probably not. However, some large whales who hold spot positions in BTC and ETH will likely seek further gains by going further up the risk curve.  The same concept applies to Sharks, Dolphins, Fish, Octopus, Crabs and Shrimps lol.

Part of this comes from unrealized paper profits. When investors see their portfolios going up, they feel more confident in taking on more risk elsewhere. Some investors will realize profits by selling some or all of their positions. Everyone is different in their approach. Some investors might be satisfied with just realizing a portion of their portfolio in profits and then moving back to the sidelines without rotating / re-investing. Some might not sell anything at all.

I know some people don't like Raoul Pal. I personally enjoy his content even though I'm not a Solana maxi like him. That said, you can learn about how some billionaires think when you watch their content. He rotated out of ETH to make a make a bet on SOL in the bear market of this cycle (he was big on ETH in the 2020-2021 cycle). Now he's rotated some of his gains in SOL to SUI.  That doesn't mean everyone should copy him. My point here is this is how some whales and institutional players play the game.

As other have mentioned, there's also the variable of retail who show up late who feel like they've missed the boat on BTC, so they jump on board whatever else hasn't set sail yet.

6830,1gpf66r,lwps057,"tldr; Dogecoin (DOGE) surged 48% in a single day, driven by bullish sentiment and Elon Musk's endorsement, as traders set their sights on a $1 price target. The memecoin's price exceeded 41 cents for the first time since May 2021, marking a 150% return over the past week and nearly tripling in the last 30 days. The rally led to over $68 million in losses on DOGE-tracked futures. Musk's proposal for a 'Department of Government Efficiency' (D.O.G.E) has fueled interest, with traders anticipating more mainstream attention and aiming for the psychological $1 mark.

Something we could do now that reddit is out of the mix is add r/CryptoCurrencyMemes to the distribution and weight all karma there much lower. I think that would be the best situation for both subreddits, moons, mods, and the users.


Not terribly important to the point, but I would dispute that r/CryptoCurrencyMemes has not caught on. Other than our new sub r/CryptoHelp, it's been the best growing subreddit in our network https://i.imgur.com/Upqz2Hm.png Just like any crypto sub, it slowed during the bear or crab months, but it's picked up when the market has.

95% of the moderation of r/CCMemes has been deleting memes that are meant to advertise and usually don't even have any humor. That would be a very negative stream of content to add to r/CC.

Additionally, he will relinquish rights to $70 million in claims on FTX customer deposits. The deal, pending approval by a federal judge, would prevent lawsuits from FTX's debtors. Trabucco resigned from Alameda in August 2022, prior to FTX's collapse, and has since avoided significant legal repercussions.

Structuring is illegal, while the money being moved might have been legally obtained, structuring is still illegal, even if the funds were legitimately earned.

So the best you can do if you wanna sell and it’s more than 10K, you talk to the exchange’s and bank’s customer support line and let them know your intentions and ask if there will be any problems before hand.

This surge is attributed to rising institutional demand, increased Bitcoin ETF inflows, a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut, and Donald Trump's presidential victory. Despite this achievement, Bitcoin's market cap remains significantly lower than gold's $17.594 trillion. Analysts warn of potential resistance due to elevated funding rates and market euphoria, while key macroeconomic events could influence future price movements.

Value accrual comes from a network of old buyers holding tokens and converting new buyers to buy tokens. The price of a token is a function of its potential to grow its network of holders and old holders’ conviction to keep holding the token.

This is why Bitcoin does really well. It is able to convert a legion of strong hands who don’t sell. And it is able to convert influential ppl to introduce products and push them for outsiders to buy, e.g. ETFs.

This video gives a nice tidbits about how price really appreciates in crypto: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqzwdGxTGc&pp=ygUKbXVyYWQgMjA0OQ%3D%3D

Ethereum’s trouble is its marketcap is so close to Bitcoin. And Ethereum’s network of holders isn’t as strong as Bitcoiners. Bitcoiners buy on the premise to just hodl and patiently wait for price appreciation. They have fewer conditionals to waiver on their conviction to hold Bitcoin. Traditionally, a lot of big Ethereum buyers are Ponzi yield seekers - not ETH itself but apps, especially DeFi, built on ETH.

I suggest: what percentage of your money total do you want to allocate as a hedge vs inflating away fiat with political risks of a govt in question? 0% is very likely a wrong answer. 0.01%? 0.1%? 1%? 10%? More? Percentage should get bigger only if you properly understand benefits/risks of both parts of the total. Act like a hedge fund of your own assets

Then learn first and allocate capital later

> How can you make long-term gains? 

My perspective very simply put: Bitcoin supercycles driven by fixed known diminishing growth of the supply, each 4 years it is cut in half. To see it on the graph, google Bitcoin price for all its history and choose Log scale. So one may speculate long-term: convert fiat into crypto in arbitrary regular portions on the descent and inverse on the ascent, in case of success increasing piles of both. Don't try to time the market, you likely will burn like the majority who do.

The strategy relies on Bitcoin's value increasing over time, allowing MSTR to issue more debt and equity to buy more Bitcoin. However, this approach carries risks, as a drop in Bitcoin's value can amplify losses due to the company's leveraged position.

Most inflows came from the US, while Europe saw minor inflows. Ether ETFs also saw significant inflows, marking a positive shift in sentiment.

The FED's proposed CBDC is deliberately designed to fail before any serious attempt to implement it. The FED will own the CBDC money, but will not provide customer service. The FED will contract customer service to retail banks, and will probably pay them fees. But the documents propose that the retail banks provide the service, and mention nothing about fees. They might be hoping that the banks charge cost-recovery fees to the customer. This would destroy adoption. The FED might be planning to pay a nominal fee to the banks. No banks would sign up to that, because their services would have an open-ended cost, probably higher than the proposed fees.

economy is strong if the S&P is strong -- if NASDAQ sees growth in the tech companies, that's a lot of ""tech money"" gains to place somewhere -- that money often is people taking their winnings to bitcoin.

so where does it crash?

make your money and get out.

7820,1gord7v,lwn0tc2,"Last cycle was really hard, the double peak was insane. It looked like we had a short cycle with the peak in March. Things were starting to get weird around 40K which is where I dumped but I was watching the market the whole time, it runs up into the '60s in March then the crash comes and I'm like well I dodged that one. Then the second peak happens and the altcoin mania. 

The only take away I really have is if you make good money, be happy you made good money and don't overthink it, you're never going to get this perfect. The first peak was insanely difficult and the second one was a little more traditional but it also kind of acted like a short cycle. Everyone was fixated on 100k which is more or less a beginning point this time. I don't know what number they're going to fix it on this time, knowing social media it's probably going to be something ridiculous like 420K but they haven't even started the top calling euphoric price targets yet

The near term price Target is probably 120 to 140 k. We will see what people do with that, would be unusual for it to be the actual high though because that's only a 2x basically from the 2021 high. There's also really really good narrative this time around and does anyone know when the ibit options are going to get approved?

7824,1gord7v,lwnycrk,"In my opinion from the past 2 bullruns, (where i sold early on one and late on the other one) its always going to be the price in the middle from 2 points, the market has to fuck both sides:

1) The ATH the doubters think we are going to reach, right now its $90K (this guys provide liquidity for the blow out top) and 2) The ATH most of the media keeps talking about, wich is around $150 to $200K for the most part (people that belive in this, will be exit liquidity on the distribuiton phase). This way you inflict pain on both sides, the people that will FOMO after $90K-$100K reached and we keep on going, but also the ultra bullish people waiting on $100K. what happened on 2021? I remember there were a lot of doubters around $45K to $55K then we broke out and you started hearing $100K and beyond, then we stopped going up and you know the rest...

So i think the ATH is going to be somewhere between $120 and $140K, thats were im going to increase my DCA out, hopefully in march, and then keep on selling for the rest of the year.",3,2024-11-11 17:41:24,1731368484.0,CryptoCurrency

Second, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts have led investors to seek Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Lastly, the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the SEC has increased institutional participation, further fueling the rally.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index hit 78, indicating heightened optimism and potential risk-taking. This surge coincides with Bitcoin's price jump and Ethereum's gains. The market's enthusiasm is partly due to geopolitical changes, including Donald Trump's re-election, which promises crypto-friendly policies. Historically, 'Extreme Greed' levels often precede market corrections, suggesting potential risks ahead.

If your assumption is that crypto will do well long term then your goal should not be to get rich quick in a short period of time. Your goal should be growing a long term position through gradual investing over a longer period of time.

This rise is part of a broader crypto rally following Donald Trump's election victory and a Federal Reserve rate cut. SOL's price has increased by 34% over the week, outperforming Bitcoin and the CoinDesk 20 Index. The token's all-time high was $260, and analysts suggest it could reach this level again soon. Solana's growth is attributed to its strong ecosystem and resurgence in decentralized finance activity.

>>For the record, VanEck believes SOL is a commodity, much like BTC and ETH. This belief is informed by evolving legal perspectives, where courts and regulators have begun to recognize that certain crypto assets may function as securities in primary markets but behave more like commodities in secondary markets. Also, over the past year Solana has made substantial progress in decentralization; the top 100 holders now control approximately 27% of the supply, a significant reduction from a year ago. Moreover, the top 10 addresses now hold less than 9%. With over 1,500 validators across 41 countries, operating in more than 300 distinct data centers, Solana boasts a Nakamoto Coefficient of 18—surpassing most networks we monitor. The upcoming Firedancer client will further bolster decentralization, ensuring no single entity can dominate the blockchain. This decentralized infrastructure, combined with SOL's utility and economic role, aligns it closely with digital commodities like BTC and ETH. We remain committed to advocating this position alongside our exchange partners to the appropriate regulators

The bitcoin price has increased by 20% in a week, with other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, dogecoin, and cardano also seeing significant gains. The Federal Reserve and China's actions are contributing to a 'perfect storm' for bitcoin's price rise.

If it goes higher, it'll go lower too. It's not a matter of if, but when. 

If you analyse trades against the market you will always second guess yourself. the best way is not to focus on micro but the macro picture of why you as an individual are investing. 

And that's why, DCA in and DCA out are great strategies. It allows you to spread the risk and sometimes lower your average buys and increase your average sell value.

8654,1gnxxrj,lwe78b2,"tldr; Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged 12% to a three-year high, reaching $0.23, driven by its association with Elon Musk and Donald Trump's election as US president. The meme coin's price has more than doubled in the past month, with predictions of further increases. Analysts suggest potential price targets of $1.17, $1.8, or even $3.9, citing a meme coin supercycle. The rally is partly attributed to the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) under Trump's administration, which Musk would lead.

8846,1gnuhu4,lwdqnar,"In the past few years I've followed a fairly conservative strategy when it comes to crypto. I try my best to protect my principal, and then play around a bit with the gains. It has probably prevented me from making massive gains, but I've enjoyed excellent returns over the past 5 years.

For example, let's say I've managed to accumulate $10 worth of Ada at an average of 30 cents. Once it hits the 60 cents mark, I will take out the principal, i.e $10 and then slowly keep taking profits in instalments till the end of the run. 

This is of course contingent on consistently investing during the bear market, and getting in at good price points. Also, you may miss out on massive returns. But I believe that it's better not to lose sleep over profits that you could've potentially made than to lose money on an investment. The market will always provide opportunities, we need to have a long term vision and always try to keep enough cash in hand so that potential opportunities can be explored.",9,2024-11-10 01:46:45,1731224805.0,CryptoCurrency

It's beginning to go up again, why would you sell now? All you're going to do is buy it back in at a higher price in a few months, feel really good about it and then ride it back down again. Like that's seriously what people do

It does however help a lot to have a goal in mind. Think about what that is, develop one and DCA out on your way to achieving it. Most the time there are at least three waves up so the first one above the old all-time high is probably going to be a 100k. People are probably going to be selling 95. After that it kind of depends on momentum but 140 would be a target, after that it's definitely no man's land. It could go on a parabolic blow off and double again, it could go a little bit higher and then do a 2021 fake out dip. In fact that could happen at any time including that 100K. 2021 was terrible, that massive drop resembled the beginning of a bear market.

Factors contributing to this growth include potential regulatory changes, favorable stablecoin regulations, and a softer SEC stance on digital assets.

This stems from investments and sponsorships made by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried before FTX's collapse. The lawsuit highlights a $12 million sponsorship of Scaramucci's SALT conference and a $10 million investment in the SkyBridge Coin Fund. FTX also acquired a 30% stake in SkyBridge's investment vehicles for $45 million. The estate claims these investments lacked financial sense and accuses SkyBridge of violating agreement terms.

9219,1gng1k2,lwcp0na,"Great question!

Yes, Kraken does support U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) for two-factor authentication (2FA). This includes using security keys like YubiKey, which provide a physical second layer of security in addition to your password. You can set this up in your Kraken Security settings under 2FA options.
Using U2F security keys for 2FA offers strong protection for your account, as access requires both something you know (your password) and something you have (the security key).

Don't tell your friends and family. 

We crypto people are very into this game and we are sure it is the future. That often results in the urge of telling people around us about crypto and why it is so cool. If you tell them and start to ""preach"" you will have partly responsibility for their losses... not in reality, but in their mind.
Remember everyone is responsible for his own actions... People tend to forget this and will get mad at you.

If they know you are invested and BTC is all over the news they will come to you and ask for a bit to start or are jealous of ur success.

If you brag about your earnings or your portfolio online, you will become a perfect target of unlimited scam approaches.

1. Always send a test transaction and check the entire address you are sending to, not just the first and last digits. 


2. Research the psychology of investing in crypto. The volatility is insane and I have experienced losing 60% - 70% of the value of my portfolio in the bear market. Downside volatility makes you want to sell and upside volatility makes you want to buy. Learning to do the opposite is a muscle you need to train. 


3. Set a long time horizon and don't invest money you would need to access within that window of time. 


4. Learn about blockchain and understand the fundamentals of the technology. Know the difference between keeping your crypto on an exchange, in a warm wallet and in a cold wallet.

Under German law, assets must be sold if their value fluctuates by over 10% to prevent losses.

The U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found him guilty of operating a major money laundering service from 2011 to 2021, facilitating over 1.2 million bitcoin transactions linked to illegal activities. The case highlights law enforcement's growing ability to trace cryptocurrency transactions and serves as a warning against using digital currencies for illicit purposes.

This increase is attributed to significant whale activity and heightened retail interest, as reported by Santiment. On November 7, there were 697 large transactions over $100,000, the highest since September, indicating institutional interest. Additionally, 37,892 unique ADA addresses were active, suggesting retail FOMO. The rally has renewed optimism among ADA supporters, though potential price pullbacks remain possible.

9581,1gn3akf,lw7kh92,"tldr; BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) recorded $60.3 million in inflows on November 8, marking the highest daily inflow in 94 days. This surge comes as Ether's price nears the $3,000 mark for the first time since August. The inflows follow a week where ETHA accumulated $84.3 million. The increase in inflows coincides with Donald Trump being declared the 47th president of the United States, which traders have linked to the spike. Other Ethereum funds also saw significant inflows during this period.

Is there any wildly different use cases? For example ETH is wildly different from BTC as it allows smart contracts.

9690,1gmu8es,lwh631d,"You're welcome - thanks for asking and being open minded about ICP.

> Can you have all the decentralised apps like eBay, Twitter etc on Ethereum as well? 

Put simply - no, you cannot have all this on top of Ethereum.  If you wanted to build an ""ETH eBay"" it would all be built on AWS and then once a token transfer had to happen that's when ETH is called.  99% of it is off chain.  This is how all the chains dApps really work.

On ICP inside of a canister smart contract you put your database, code, storage, web pages, etc. entirely on the chain itself.  There's no need for any outside cloud services.  It's 100% onchain.  ICP is also running AI onchain as well and it's improving pretty quickly.

The use cases for ICP are basically endless while traditional blockchains are really just moving tokens around.  You don't need firewalls or anti-virus like you do on traditional web2 architecture:

>Tamperproof architecture: Systems and services built on the Internet Computer are secure by default. They don't require protection from firewalls, SIEM logging, or other traditional cybersecurity frameworks because the platform itself is designed to be tamperproof.


It's also the only actual autonomous DAO - the protocol handles all updates so no one is directly in charge.  Proposals have to pass or nothing gets updated.  Any app can be built with this framework through the SNS too.

9843,1gmlq3p,lw562rq,"The original article (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QdlzRDmg4IiiWCzv4uYBBQ) does not mention the full name of the ""spy"" who sold state secrets. There are times when Chinese news outlets have doctored news articles or news reports (on the air or in text format) in general to try to engineer a shift in thinking for ordinary Chinese people. I'll get to this later, but I'm leaning towards saying this was embellished to make people in China think that the government is actually doing their job.               

Link to original Chinese article: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QdlzRDmg4IiiWCzv4uYBBQ - Note: we don't see any real photos of a criminal, only ""dramatized"" images.            

Part I find ultra-sus: https://prnt.sc/25spiUbwlLH5                    

The part of this article I am talking about specifically is ""汪某某.""  The characters 某某 can be thought of as ""So-and-so."" The CCP will frequently write the full names of criminals that are sentenced to life or execution (at least in the past they did). I think the only *plausible* reason why they could have redacted his first name is to conceal what access to confidential information he had access to. ""Well then why do we know his surname from the article?"" you may ask. Well, 汪 is a really common surname in China.               

The probability of embellished news / signs to look for: I can name an example of a foreign woman helping earthquake refugees in Sichuan China 15 years ago. Before the news segment put the camera on her, they said that she made the claim, ""I am Chinese. these are my people. I'm here to help."" But when the camera cut to this woman, she was not heard saying this. She was only saying, ""I am here to help."" Another televised news segment made mention of a migrant worker who was sitting awkwardly on a bus ride home to not let the dirt he got on himself from his construction job get on other people. Allegedly a woman on the bus yelled at him for being a dirty country-sider, then a 10-year-old boy stood up for the migrant worker and said, ""If him and people like him didn't come here to work, our city wouldn't exist! Don't bully him!"" And the message behind that was ""solidarity"" or ""unity"" among the people of China, regardless of where they are from. Oh, and the camera that was on the bus did not capture this ""scuffle"" at all.",1,2024-11-08 14:56:05,1731099365.0,CryptoCurrency

This move allows for the release of cash to investors as tokens, simplifying the reinvestment process and reducing administrative burdens. Tokenization on Hedera also promises faster settlement times, potentially leading to real-time liquidity and releasing billions of dollars of liquidity into the market. The use of Hedera's 'proof of stake' blockchain is seen as scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable. Additionally, abrdn has become the largest external shareholder of Archax, the company behind the tokenization process on Hedera.

9985,1gmfcgp,lw3pu2f,"These are good points. TON finality is not instant.

> Am I missing something here

**What is finality?**

* Probabilistic finality: Chance of transaction being final is very high
* Economic finality: Chance of transaction being final is near-100% AND it's almost economically infeasible to revert transactions
* Deterministic finality: Chance of transaction being final is 100% due to protocol

A lot of fast finality is deterministic finality forced by protocol. **It's just hard-coded into protocol that blocks have instant finality without taking into account security and economic  incentives to attack.**

Algorand and Avalanche are set to 1 block because ... that's just what the devs said. They also have really high safety thresholds (needing 85-95% of stake power to attack the network), so they just assume it's not possible to attack. In reality, it is possible to attack, it's just very unlikely. The downside to having a very high safety threshold is that it's really easy to censor them, needing only 5-15% of stake to censor a block.

Cardano and Solana have around 1-3 minute finality.

Bitcoin has probabilistic finality. Reorgs can happen and do happen occasionally, but the chances are low. If there is a determined attacker with $20B of mining equipment gathered over many years, they can reorg the chain fairly easily.

Ethereum has economic finality. It has 12s blocks, but it sets finality at 2 epochs (12-19 minutes) because that's what makes sense from their security design.  Anyone who attacks the network (double-propose or double-attest) will be economically-wiped out.",2,2024-11-08 10:38:33,1731083913.0,CryptoCurrency

I do have a question tho. The TON blockchain is officially released, not in beta like Solana. However, it has faced several a lot of downtime incidents, like  sometimes lasting >6hrs.

This raises the question: what's the purpose of launching another blockchain if it can't reliably handle high demand or onboard a large user base under pressure? While they claim to have a unique, “accidental invention” in their blockchain (source: TON Mining https://ton.org/en/mining ), the frequent failures, and long downtimes, slower performance, and fees that are higher than Solana and some Layer 2 solutions make it hard to see the competitive advantage.

any idea what is the rationale behind its development although having these issues?

Like despite being ranking in the top 20 by market cap and having official USDT integration (not bridged), they preform poorely in almost all metrics. I've been a TON user since it was $2 and am active on Telegram, which naturally drew me to their ecosystem. Even during low-usage periods, the transaction speed wasn't particularly impressive. While other major chains like BTC, ETH, and SOL have had their issues with block production, these were typically very brief and rare occurrences - unlike TON's almost persistent problems.
The centralization concerns are also worth noting. 


I really hope the TON team steps up with some improvements, whether it’s updating their client software(considering they’re the only mainter for the client software which gives them substantial control over network behavior)

This trend indicates a shift towards regulated digital assets, driven by increased regulatory clarity and investor preference for structured products over direct Bitcoin purchases. The movement towards ETFs is seen as a maturation of the cryptocurrency market, potentially leading to broader adoption and integration into mainstream finance.

A successful breach could lead to a significant rally, positioning Solana as a key player in the market upswing. Technical indicators, such as the 100-day Simple Moving Average and the Composite Trend Oscillator, show strong bullish momentum and buying pressure. If Solana breaks through $194, it could target its all-time high of $209. However, failure to breach may result in a pullback to support levels at $164 or $137.

BTC and Doge were profitable and Jasmy was not. All three had a success rate of around 50%.

This surge is attributed to Trump's perceived pro-business stance and the Democratic Party's negative view on cryptocurrencies. Prominent figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk, who are associated with Trump, have also influenced this positive sentiment. Despite Trump's past anti-crypto stance, the Republican party's broader support for digital assets has fueled optimism for greater adoption and legitimization of cryptocurrencies.

Upgrades for Ethereum have generally been named after cities that held relevance to Ethereum, so we had the London hardfork that introduced the burn, Paris had The Merge (PoS) etc.

Then upgrades for the Beacon chain have been named after stars, starting with Altair.

Since The Merge, when both chains have been upgraded together each one still gets it's own name, then they get melded together when the fork goes to mainnet.

So we had Shanghai for Execution and Capella for the Beacon Chain, and they got blended to 'Shapella'.


Then last March we had Cancun and Deneb, which became 'Dencun'.

The decision follows concerns over the platform's legality under French law, particularly after a French user placed large bets on the U.S. presidential election. Polymarket, known for its prediction markets, has seen significant trading volumes, but the ANJ is assessing its compliance with French gambling laws. The move mirrors similar scrutiny in the U.S. by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The card amount per tier has been fixed for 3 years, if we just go back to the last ATH.  In 3 years we all know prices of everything has increased, whatever you’re buying essentially.   They have taken an opportunity to increase prices for staking and locking up, they’ve produced a good roadmap.  However many coins you’re holding, the price has increased meaning you have more than you did a week ago.  Which, coincidentally everyone was moaning about the price and why don’t CDC do something about the price!   Well they did, and you’re still moaning, it’s hardly their fault about when you bought.  Plus you’ve had ample opportunity to buy and bring your average price down in order to maximize profits, but you didn’t.   

It’s a done deal, you have chances to do something, stop moaning and make a change, buy or sell, upgrade or unstake.  

No one is forcing you to do anything, it’s a business and they’ve made good business decisions for years now.   Everyone was moaning when they reduced rewards, so many advising people to leave.

Almost immediately they started slashing benefits and rates month after month until it sucked. Now all their benefits already suck on top of all their high fees and spread.

That $4000 CRO i bought even staking it for 3 years is only worth $1200 now. I made about $3000 from the staking rewards on usdc before they made it not worth it anymore so i about broke even overall but my initial investment is probably never going to go back to my break even price even with all the staking it's been doing for years.

I am not going to upgrade my card, I’ve already made that decision, I like the new roadmap and for now my strategy will remain the same, keep adding/staking.  With a view to seeing where we are during the next 12 months.  

I believe a lot of people are upgrading though, hopefully they’re also attracting a lot of new customers, at least to the card.   
I agree not many are probably in profit and those that are , probably keep quiet about it.  But again we all have strategies, sometimes they work, others don’t, that’s just life.  You implemented your strategy and it seems it hasn’t been great in the CDC case, but you’re blaming the company.

On Nov 5th 2017 the price found a resistance at $7500, retraced to $5866 on Nov 12th, then shoot up past $7500 on its way to $20000.

July 2018 the dead-cat-bounce stopped at around $7500 and then continued falling to the bear market lows.

May to June 2019 the price fluctuated between $7500 to $8000 when recovering after the bear market. Then it shot up past to stop at $13000.

Sept 2019 to may 2020 the price spent the time fluctuating around $7500.

May 14th 2024, Bitcoin stops its climb just shy of $75000.

November 7th 2024 Bitcoin retraces after going over $75000.

Do you see a pattern here? $75X is a psychological barrier. To people numbers over $75 look more like $100 than $50. Many traders buy or sell around those numbers.

The market shows strong fundamentals, with Bitcoin derivatives indicating improved sentiment and a lack of excessive leverage, supporting further gains. Despite this, traders remain cautious due to past price resistance at $72,000 and upcoming US Federal Reserve decisions. The potential impact of Trump's policies on institutional adoption and the US fiscal trajectory could influence Bitcoin demand. Overall, Bitcoin derivatives suggest a bullish outlook, though market adjustments may take time.

This significant trading activity occurred amid a Bitcoin price rally to around $74,400. Despite the high trading volume, it doesn't directly translate to net inflows, as only about $600 million of the $4.5 billion first-day volume for Bitcoin ETFs constituted actual inflows. The trading spike coincided with the 2024 US elections, where Donald Trump was projected to win a second term.

This decline marks the lowest point since April 2021 and has sparked discussions about Ethereum's market cycle and its potential approach to its lower logarithmic regression trend line, which has historically provided support during bearish phases. Analyst Benjamin Cowen suggests ETH could reach this level in the coming weeks as part of a broader cycle reset. Despite previous optimism, Ethereum's valuation against Bitcoin has steadily declined, echoing past cycles.

The cryptocurrency faces immediate resistance at 21.7 cents, a level that previously capped gains in March. The golden cross, a bullish technical pattern, suggests a continued upward movement for Dogecoin, driven by positive market sentiment following Donald Trump's return to the White House.

So if you trade on a 100$ on a 10:1 lever, you pay 100$ and borrow 900$ for a total of $1000, that is your position. (10x your 100$). 

The liquidation-level for levers is always 100/lever, or in this case 100/10 = 10%

If your 10x lever asset drops by 10%, your $1000 position will only be worth $900, exactly the amount you borrowed. The broker closes your position, takes back the 900$ they lent you and the $100 loss is all yours.

On the opposite case, if the price goes up by 10%, your $1000 position is now worth $1100, you can close the position, return the 900$ and are left with 200$, a 100% gain on your investment.

11534,1gkv7j7,lvp58bo,">So let's say I open a long on BTC with $1000 at 20x. I put a stop loss at maybe -5%, so I stand to lose $50 max

No.  That would be investing $1k without leverage. If BTC goes down 5% and you have 20x leverage you just took 100% loss.

If BTC remains flat or tades within a range say +/-3% then you slowly lose money due to the interest on money borrowed to make the leveraged trade.",3,2024-11-06 06:32:42,1730896362.0,CryptoCurrency

With leverage of x10, if the price drops by 10% you lose your money forever. 

Etc.

On top of that there are fees for a position to stay open on the market. Depending on the balance of longs vs shorts, the fee might be either negative or positive. In most cases your position will be on the loosing side, so keeping it opened for long might lead to small passive losses. 

——

This is the general story. On top of that there’s a number of details and settings that should be understood if one decides to follow the dark path. But the general idea is that it is unwise to play with leverage before being well experienced in spot (non-leveraged) trading, as statistically you will lose your money.",2,2024-11-06 04:31:47,1730889107.0,CryptoCurrency

11541,1gkv7j7,lvooa9v,"This may get wordy and confusing but I hope you understand lol.

Essentially you stand to lose whatever you put on the trade on isolated positions. On cross margin you take your entire derivatives wallet.
 
Now say you have $100 margin on 20x for BTC and a stop loss at 5%. Please note that 20x is very big. I personally don’t go above 5.

So with a stop loss at 5%, that’s $5. As you’re on x20 leverage, the price needs to move 5/20 = $0.25 for you it to trigger.

Once it triggers it places a market order to close your entire position so you may lose more/less than $5 depending on the order book.

If the price moves up and you set your stop loss above your entry then yes, there’s 0 risk. Do remember to take note of your opening and closing fees though.

If you have no stop loss, a price movement of 100/20 = $5 will liquidate you. Probably less due to fees and margin rate. Margin rate (usually 1.5%) is the % of your initial entry you need in order to maintain your position. In simple terms, you need 1.5% of your $100 = $1.5 for it to not liquidate. 

TL;DR: Say price of BTC is $100. When you are on 20x leverage, when price becomes $101 your unrealised profit is $1x20. Likewise if price becomes $99 your unrealised loss is $1x20. There is no risk if price goes up and you set your loss above your entry.",1,2024-11-06 04:27:56,1730888876.0,CryptoCurrency

Originally intended as free NFTs documenting a $243 million theft investigation, the NFTs were automatically converted into tradable ERC-20 tokens. The token's value surged to a $15 million market cap but later dropped to $4 million. ZachXBT expressed displeasure with the speculative trading, emphasizing his intent was to archive content permanently.

11841,1gkiha4,lvlmi4h,"tldr; Bitcoin is currently holding above $70,000, with market focus on a potential breakout. Analyst TradingShot suggests Bitcoin could reach $170,000, based on its historical tendency to rally after rebounding from the 50-week Moving Average (1W MA-50). Bitcoin has recently tested its $73,800 All-Time High (ATH), and a breakout above this level could confirm a bullish trend. The 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, around $170,000, is a significant target. Holding $70,000 is crucial, and a breach could signal a retest of the 1W MA50 support.

Transaction verification will become easier, and Ethereum's transaction history will be optimized for efficiency.

Optimism, even more so Arbitrum, and a few others are taking in transactions and ""roll up"" data to Ethereum making users feel safe. Whether that safety is real, the impact pressure is significant. Even Vitalik uses L2s. 

If less fees have to be paid, then less ether needs to be bought, since fees are always paid in ether.

The flocking created a sudden vacuum, and the price of ether is slowly adjusting as adoption overall continues to grow.

That's assuming OP is asking gain potential.

Ethereum has **more than 95% dominance** of the premier Dapp developer ecosystem. Of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by mcap, 25 are built on top of Ethereum. Only 1 (Raydian ranked at #70) is built on another Layer 1 platform.

25 to 1. That’s the ratio of dominance. And with strong developer ecosystem network effects, Ethereums lead is insurmountable.

This is the metric that matters. The market likes to see transaction volume and fees generated, and Ethereum is strong there but Solana has been juicing its numbers with trading bots.

People with only a surface level of insight and understanding when it comes to crypto don't know the difference, they think it's still an open race, but if you look at which chain is being chosen to build on by the big companies it's always Ethereum. For smart contracts Ethereum has already won. Take 1 single app, Aave for instance, has more TVL than any other L1. The top 3 L2s together on Ethereum have more TVL than any other L1. Ethereum has more users, activity, volume, developers, development, etc. Almost everything originates on Ethereum. All exciting developments in crypto happen on Ethereum. 

Ethereum has been leading the way in crypto development since its inception. Concepts and designs that were thought to be impossible, the holy grail of crypto, are being invented on Ethereum.

People used to say a decentralized stablecoin was the holy grail of crypto, and this was made possible by Ethereum. People used to talk about the scaling trilemma, this was solved on Ethereum. People said Proof of Stake (real PoS, not *delegated* PoS) was impossible, a pipe dream, and implementing it on Ethereum has akin to performing open heart surgery on a moving train (lol) and guess what, it happened on Ethereum. 

I think there are 3 main reasons price isn't exploding right now. Biggest 1 is that BTC is stealing the limelight right now. 2nd reason is that unlike other L1s like SOL or ADA, Ethereum isn't pumping $100s of millions into marketing to pump the price. 3rd reason is that retail crypto investors are unsophisticated and honestly don't know very much about anything. Like just look at the average person commenting on any thread about anything on this sub. No one knows anything, they are just latching onto and repeating talking points they heard from twitter influencers. But in the end it's not the unsophisticated retail investors who decide what chain will win, it's the big companies moving their infrastructure on-chain, and they are all moving to Ethereum.",12,2024-11-05 23:56:25,1730872585.0,CryptoCurrency

12110,1gk75sb,lvivatl,"tldr; Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has filed a motion to dismiss the SEC's amended lawsuit, arguing that the SEC cannot distinguish between crypto securities and Beanie Babies. The motion criticizes the SEC for not providing clear standards for identifying investment contracts in crypto transactions. It also challenges the SEC's request for disgorgement and restrictions on Zhao's market participation, labeling them as meritless. The filing claims the SEC's legal theories are flawed, despite extensive court guidance and discovery.

This also doesn't say anything about their cash liabilities or general solvency.

If these firms wanted to be really above board they could, in fact, get an actual Audit done. The reason they won't is because they'd need to do the corporate equivalent of a strip search, cavity search, XRay, and MRI to satisfy the firm in question that they weren't trying to lie to them... and none of these firms has been willing to do that... for *some reason*.",2,2024-11-05 17:13:59,1730848439.0,CryptoCurrency

The coin, which had previously seen significant growth, plummeted after Coffeezilla's video highlighted Tate's inconsistent views on cryptocurrency and alleged that his business operates like a pyramid scheme. The video also suggested that Tate's move into crypto might be financially motivated due to legal issues. The crash left many of Tate's followers with significant losses.

Grand and Bruno exploited a flaw in pre-2015 RoboForm versions, which linked password generation to date and time, to recreate the password.

They consider Donald Trump to be more crypto-friendly compared to Kamala Harris, who may maintain the Democratic Party's strict stance on cryptocurrency. Key factors for Bitcoin's potential growth include U.S. fiscal irresponsibility, high debt levels, and monetary expansion, which increase interest in hard assets. The success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is also expected to boost demand.

1. Period (Column A): Represents consecutive four-year periods, presumably corresponding to specific halving cycles.


2. ATL (Column B): Shows the all-time low value reached during each period.


3. Date of ATL (Column C): Specifies the date when the ATL was reached for each period.


4. ATH (Column D): Indicates the all-time high value reached during each period.


5. Date of ATH (Column E): Provides the date when the ATH was achieved.


6. Percentage Growth (Cycle ATL-ATH) (Column F): Calculates the growth percentage from ATL to ATH within each cycle using the formula:



\text{Percentage Growth} = \frac{\text{ATH} - \text{ATL}}{\text{ATL}} \times 100

8. Percentage Growth (Prev ATH - Pres ATH) (Column H): Measures the percentage growth from the ATH of one period to the ATH of the next period, based on the formula:

This projection is based on historical trends where Bitcoin's price often sees a 40% increase after nearing its all-time high. The 'Bitcoin black hole effect' suggests Bitcoin's dominance grows with each cycle, drawing value from altcoins. Institutional interest, such as BlackRock's investments, supports this bullish outlook. Additionally, changes in accounting rules could encourage more companies to hold Bitcoin, further driving its price upward.

The breach led to a temporary suspension of withdrawals, but MetaWin's swift response restored 95% of user withdrawals, minimizing the impact. The stolen funds were traced to exchanges KuCoin and HitBTC. MetaWin has since enhanced its security measures and is working to recover the remaining funds, emphasizing the importance of robust cybersecurity in the online gambling sector.

Despite challenges from competitors, it dominates decentralized exchanges and real-world asset markets. Investors remain cautious, but the outlook may change as Ethereum's potential becomes clearer.

Bottom line, credit cards are not anyones but the credit card companies, just like bank accounts. Credit remains the banks, they are allowing people to use. If the credit card firm is not making any money out of you, they have little reason to keep you as a customer, in fact paying your balance off in full each month actually costs them to keep you as a customer.

This spending, primarily directed towards a non-partisan super PAC focused on supporting pro-crypto candidates and opposing skeptics, represents nearly half of all corporate contributions this election cycle. This unprecedented financial involvement by the crypto sector aims to make crypto regulation a key issue for candidates, with the majority of funds coming from companies like Coinbase and Ripple. This surge in spending follows the Citizens United ruling, which allows unlimited corporate contributions to super PACs, and positions crypto corporations as major political spenders, second only to fossil fuel corporations in total election-related spending.

Polymarket is bad. It is full of oracle manipulation, improper setups and illiquid markets that can be swayed to look one way with chump change for certain individuals and all government agencies.

UMA oracles shouldn’t be trusted. Not saying they’ll never be robust, but are not right now and the fact that they are being used to settle millions of dollars in bets is ridiculous.

This challenges the notion that Bitcoin is more volatile than tech stocks. Tesla's volatility was marked by a significant single-day gain of +21.92%. The data suggests Bitcoin is maturing as an asset, with increased stability and institutional buy-in, potentially positioning it as a modern safe-haven asset amidst inflationary concerns.

This includes compliance requirements for transparency and risk management, aligning with global standards. The regulations, effective from March 2024 with a phased compliance until August 2025, require VASPs to report transactions over $1,350. These measures aim to boost the economy but may increase compliance costs and drive users to peer-to-peer transactions.

Exchanges will many times double count volume. So when I buy $1 of ETH and you sell $1 of ETH instead of counting that as $1 of volume, which is how a traditional exchange would do it, they count it as $2.

Polymarket has figured out an even better way to fudge the volume numbers:

If someone buys the Hillary Clinton to win the presidential election for $0.01, Polymarket counts that as $1 of volume because the nominal value of the contract at expiration if she wins is $1

So not just double counting volume 100x the actual underlying cash changing hands.

13881,1gi499l,lvf4fyz,"Well basically, its due to adoption.

Many ransom attackers actually offer a Monero discount. Lets say someone asks you for 10k USD worth of Bitcoin in ransom. It is not uncommon that they at the same time will also offer you to pay your ransom in Monero at a 10% discount, lowering your ransom to 9k USD. 

As long, as they have good OPSEC, it is impossible to catch them. But the cases of those being caught, are the ones, where the criminal didnt have good OPSEC. Just as bad OPSEC as their victim had, which led them to becoming a victim in the first place.

So far not a single Monero transaction has ever been deanonymized. Criminals using Monero have been caught in the past, because they accidentally uploaded private documents of their victims (because they didnt pay the ransom) alongside their entire home folder. Thats how the Vastaamo guy got caught for example. Others just talk way too much. Most criminals actually just talk way too much. Thats why we dont need everything to be transparent.

In the end, criminals will just catch themselves, due to their bad OPSEC outside the Monero network. Its very hard to fuck up inside the Monero network, but incredibly easy to fuck up outside of it.",1,2024-11-04 15:50:59,1730757059.0,CryptoCurrency

Please note that promoting tax evasion violates Rule 4.

Do not endorse, suggest, advocate, instruct others, or ask for help with tax evasion.

This strategic buying has resulted in an unrealized profit of $42.3 million, indicating a successful investment approach. The whale's consistent purchases, often around 250 BTC, suggest a bullish outlook on Bitcoin's future. These large-scale acquisitions are seen as a positive market signal, reflecting increased interest from high-net-worth individuals and potentially influencing market sentiment and price stability.

Volatility works both ways. I can also buy Bitcoin at $65K too, and buy something with it worth now $70K. And I've now outpaced inflation annually in the span of just a week.

This is not something new, nor unique to crypto.

Any currency, any financial instruments, will always have some volatility and not be perfectly synched with other instruments.

If you go to the UK and convert your dollars to pounds, you're also gonna have some weeks when your $20K is gonna buy you £16K, and the following week it's only gonna buy you £14K. So you lost $2k in purchasing power in a matter of a week.

For others using Blockchain is now the only way to make things happen and move into the right direction and the big adoption is already happening. 

It will not happen from the richest countries and trickle down to the poor cause in the rich countries people use Blockchain mostly to gamble and try and find assets that will make them more money. The mindset is totally different and none of this technology is actually important since most of people have it ok. It's not supposed to be a tech that will just be set up to make you more rich by just sitting on a ""coin"". It's a delusion and the ponzinomics of the whole space just enforce that image. 

What it is, is a tech that removes a lot of friction in sending, receiving funds and keeping data secure and always accessible AND if ideal situations make it happen, yes it will have assets that are better.hedged against inflation. 

For places like India, Argentina, Brazil, Afganistan prople already use the chain to change their lives, to get access to services and privileges that they never had before and the change is happening swiftly and in next few years it will take over.

Then slowly he has eroded away the idea of Bitcoin as being *A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution* as described in the whitepaper, and has solidified his position of thought leadership by sending his culty 'cyber hornets' after anyone who questions  the new narrative of 'Store of value'.

Now his control over mindshare has reached the point where he can go full mask off and deride the very idea of self-custody, in favour of people just trusting his company to hold all the BTC and take leverage on it.

The strength of demand for DeFi projects, dApps, and NFTs contributes to this trend. Ethereum's Exchange Supply Ratio has decreased, suggesting increased accumulation. Currently, ETH trades at $2,516, with analysts predicting a potential retest of $2,800.

This scheme, involving 'wash trading,' misled investors by inflating trading volumes. Andriunin could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The U.S. Department of Justice seized over $25 million in assets related to these activities.

Trust issues arise from concerns about security and the decentralized nature of blockchain. Financial resources are limited, especially post-pandemic. Interoperability remains a major hurdle, as different blockchain systems often cannot communicate effectively.

He criticized the documentary for advancing unproven theories and noted that HBO did not ask him to refute these claims, despite having evidence that could challenge the documentary's narrative. Todd emphasized the speculative nature of the documentary's claims.

The tax authority has been quite literally scamming citizens when it comes to crypto for years.

Crypto is also asymmetrically taxed, meaning you get around 20% back if you lose, but pay up to 53% if you win. This is *per trade*.

This has led to court cases (that the citizen lost) where people who had trading bots like the binance bots etc, and did hundreds, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of tiny trades. These people received a bill for millions of Danish crowns, as even if the majority of trades were profitable, the asymmetry of the tax meant you lost no matter what unless you had like a 100% hit rate which no one has.

When they tried to refute it they were told to bugger off and pay. Let me be clear, these were ordinary tax paying citizens who lost their houses and quite frankly lives over this theft. They were already down in losses from their crypto bots, but got executed by the same system that they had been contributing to their entire lives.",143,2024-11-01 06:17:24,1730459844.0,CryptoCurrency

Conversely, countries like Bahrain, Bermuda, and Switzerland offer zero CGT, making them attractive for crypto investors.

14803,1ggukdg,luslux9,"tldr; Days before the U.S. presidential election, Polymarket is under scrutiny for potential wash trading on election odds. Investigations by Chaos Labs and Inca Digital suggest that a significant portion of Polymarket's $2.7 billion trading volume on election bets may be due to wash trading, which artificially inflates activity. This raises concerns about the platform's influence on public opinion and election outcomes, especially as Polymarket's odds show a 67% chance of victory for Donald Trump, contrary to tighter race predictions from other polls.

This aligns with the 'Uptober' trend, despite earlier struggles to surpass $70,000. Historically, Bitcoin has risen on Halloween, except in 2018 and 2022. The current momentum is fueled by institutional interest and potential political impacts, with Bitcoin ETFs seeing significant inflows. Analysts suggest a bullish phase if Bitcoin remains above $70,000, though caution is advised due to overbought conditions.

Please note that promoting tax evasion violates Rule 4.  This is [a site wide rule](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [a subreddit rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules/).  Do not endorse, suggest, advocate, instruct others, or ask for help with tax evasion.  Do not be coy and sarcastically recommend against it or suggest using a privacy coin in response to an IRS inquiry.

Note:  Tax discussion is allowed as long as the above rules are not violated.

This discovery could lead to potential refunds for thousands of taxpayers who overpaid taxes in 2023 and 2024. The finding is based on a detailed examination of regulations, particularly Article 5, Section 2 of Legislative Decree 66/2014, which suggests crypto-assets should be taxed at 12.5%. Taxpayers are advised to seek refunds for the overpaid amount.

This marks the first activity in nearly two years from the government wallet holding these assets. Over 82,000 ANT tokens were sold through AragonDAO’s redemption process, netting approximately $1.07 million in ETH. This move is part of efforts to liquidate seized crypto assets, coinciding with AragonDAO's winding-down process. The liquidation is part of the broader fallout from the collapse of Alameda and FTX.

Look at the U.S. data: personal credit card debt is at an all time high, more than half the country living paycheck to paycheck, personal savings rate is at a 10+ year low. People still feel the effects of inflation in their pocket and don't have spare money. This is why retail is mostly staying away this time, no headlines despite BTC at ATH, etc. Nobody still believes that crypto will revolutionize entire industries anymore. There's very few new usecases on the horizon that would get people excited, at this point it's basically just Bitcoin aka ""digital gold"" and then some meme coin gambling for the degenerates that think they are smarter than the rest of us and can get rich quick.

The only money coming into crypto is big money, e.g. Saylor, Blackrock, ETFs. Unlike retail, these guys still have deep pockets. Also keep in mind that a lot less money was needed to push BTC from 20k to 69k than to push it from 690k or whereever you think we will be going. A lot more money is needed and I don't see where it should be coming from. Inflation is sticky, they can maybe cut the rates a little but there won't be QE stimulus as we saw in the past. I think we have been pampered in the last 10 years with easy money (not just crypto, also look at the S&P500 chart). This will not simply continue forever. 

My 2c is that the rest of this cycle won't be near as glorious as many here hope.

There is a reason people are pivoting to memes over utility. They want to avoid the sell-pressure to feed this bloated industry, avoid areas where there is a lot of structural selling.

Good question, let's look at some data:


**Smart Contracts:** 

Electric Capital does a deep analysis each year of all development in crypto. For their last report they looked at 485 million code commits across 818k open-source repositories.

When they filtered out all the non-code stuff like edits to readme files etc and code that is just copy-pasted from other places, they found that about 71% of all new/novel code is first found on one particular ecosystem, Ethereum:

https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=71-of-contract-code-is


**DeFi:** 


Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem is literally bigger than that of every other chain combined: 

https://defillama.com/chains

And that's even counting Ethereum L2s as different chains... 3 of the top 10 chains by DeFi value are Ethereum L2s.



**RWA projects:** 

In total about $13.3 billion worth of traditional financial assets have been brought onchain, about $12.4 billion of that is on Ethereum:

https://www.rwa.xyz/


Blackrock's trial treasury fund on Ethereum has grown from $100m to over $500m in about 7 months. They have stated their intention to ultimately tokenize every stock and bond, and said that will happen on Ethereum. 

https://etherscan.io/token/0x7712c34205737192402172409a8f7ccef8aa2aec


Visa are launching a RWA platform to allow financial assets to be moved onto Ethereum:

 https://investor.visa.com/news/news-details/2024/Visa-Introduces-the-Visa-Tokenized-Asset-Platform/default.aspx


WisdomTree (an asset management company with over $110 billion AUM) have launched one too:

For examples of reporting on Solana's manipulated figures here are some articles describing it:

* https://protos.com/did-jump-crypto-cause-solana-stablecoin-volume-to-collapse/

The Bitcoin futures premium is at a four-month high, indicating bullish investor conviction. Although Bitcoin's price closely followed gold, recent US economic data suggests reduced demand for alternative assets.

15606,1gfwtsb,lulaswp,"tldr; Kraken, a major American crypto exchange, has laid off staff to become 'leaner and faster,' despite Bitcoin's near all-time high. Arjun Sethi joins as co-CEO alongside David Ripley. The layoffs are part of a strategic pivot to position Kraken as a leading crypto platform. While Kraken didn't specify the number of layoffs, reports suggest a 15% staff reduction. This move follows similar layoffs by Consensys and dYdX, driven by regulatory uncertainties and legal costs. Kraken continues to expand, launching a new Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, Ink.

BTC Yield is a key performance indicator (“KPI”) that represents the % change period-to-period of the ratio between the Company’s bitcoin holdings and its Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding. Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of the Company’s actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of each period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible notes, exercise of all outstanding stock option awards, and settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units. Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding is not calculated using the treasury method and does not take into account any vesting conditions (in the case of equity awards), the exercise price of any stock option awards or any contractual conditions limiting convertibility of convertible debt instruments.",3,2024-10-30 17:16:12,1730326572.0,CryptoCurrency
