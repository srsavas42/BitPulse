Like Bitcoin, don't risk anything you're not willing to lose, consider your purchase the cost of protest.

If you can't afford to risk your money, leave that app a one star review, and call your Congressperson, Senator, Mayor, Dentist, I don't care and report this crap to the SEC.

l70vrq,gl5kib3,"**Melvin Capital lost tremendous amounts of money due to over-extended shorting of Gamestock (GME) stock. Retail investors discovered this and began buying the security to leverage against their position. Melvin Capital was granted close to 2.7 billion dollars in loans by Citadel Securities, LLC (investment firm) for liquidity.**

**Citadel Securities (market maker) processes ROBINHOOD FINANCIAL, LLC’s transactions. To prevent further losses, they potentially pressured Robinhood to restrict buying of specific stocks such as GME, AMC, NOK, and others by retail investors. As of 1/28, GME is specifically blocked from being bought on Robinhood - an unprecedented event following no actual SEC rules or Robinhood terms and conditions.**

**Other retail trading sites continue to allow trades - this is Robinhood specifically curtailing market action, likely under specific pressure from Citadel and Citadel Securities.**
**Note that although they are separate corporate entities, Citadel and Citadel Securities are owned by the same individual - Ken Griffin.**

**These companies seem to be colluding behind the scenes to block legitimate investment actions by individuals, to their own profit. Their communications may reveal this manipulation.**

**Thus:**
**We make the argument that Robinhood Financial, LLC in coordination with Citadel Securites, LLC and Melvin Capital Management, LP willfully engaged in market manipulation by restricting buying power of the security GME by actionably preventing its users from exercising their financial leverage to cover their position. This has resulted in immeasurable losses to millions of users unable to trade the security in a way that is financially in their best interest according to their own belief.**

**Please investigate communications between this brokerage and the hedge funds who fund them and would likely profit off of the restricted trading of the security.**",26,2021-01-28 16:08:48,1611871728.0,Bitcoin

“I have been a loyal Robinhood customer for YEARS.  I am very dissatisfied that the company decided to arbitrarily freeze purchases of shares in companies like NAKD, AMC, BB or GME.  What Robinhood has done is nothing short of market manipulation, not only that, but the platform has then successfully cut raising capital for those named companies which undercuts the purpose of the Stock Market and investing.  Investors put money toward a company they hold value in, IRREGARDLESS of if there is an extreme volatility tied to that company.  That risk is on the shoulders of the investor not Robinhood, unless of course Robinhood was trying to prevent immense losses for other customers in short position, which then becomes market manipulation again- a FLAGRANT SEC violation.”

kpi6pa,ghyq0x9,"That's great man. I've been there and it's a massive relief that you don't even realize can be life changing.

I very quickly built up a debt shortly after turning 18. Student loans, a maxed out credit card and financed furniture for an apartment. I was close to 20k in debt in all, mostly from the student loans. On top of other issues in my life like not finishing my degree, these debts were a constant drain on my finances for years. The furniture debt went to collections and damaged my credit, even as I had to settle to pay it off in a lump sum. I was making minimum payments for years struggling to get by and watching my principle slowly grow. There were periods of unemployment when I had to defer payments and watch it grow much faster. You get to the point you never expect it to go away and just try not to pay it any mind.

I didn't sell bitcoin. Unfortunately, for me, my grandmother died. But she was able to leave my sister and me, her only grandchildren, her retirement savings. I was able to pay it all off in one fell swoop, invest the remainder in my own retirement account, and almost 4 years later I'm still debt free. I've refused to go into debt for anything else since. It's such a relief not having this huge and growing monster constantly looming overhead as you make monthly sacrifices to it. That sense of security is priceless.

Congratulations, friend. Keep it up. Keep the debt off, start working on savings for emergencies (6 months pay! Seriously! Especially now that you own a home!), then the rest is money for guilt free investment, charity or play, whichever makes you happier. I'm genuinely happy for you.",8,2021-01-03 10:14:01,1609690441.0,Bitcoin

* I obviously didn't explain the completely digital, no physical coins part to her very well, my bad.
* I honestly don't know where she got it or how much she payed for it but, as an ex-accountant she is fairly good with money so I highly doubt she spent €30k on it.
* I haven't, and will not be telling her, she doesn't need to know. It's very wholesome that she went out of her way to get it for me.

o5jzxg,h2ob8js,"There are loads of redditors commenting who are **completely uninformed** about what they're watching. I want to try and clear up some of the numerous misconceptions. Please note that Lightning Network is not perfect and there are legitimate criticisms, but few people in this thread actually understand well enough to levie those criticisms.

* *I can already do this with PayPal/Venmo/WeChat/Alipay*

Those are all 100% centralized, permissioned systems that utilize inflationary fiat currency and can ban you and seize your funds at any time. These services may appear instant to end users, but still have to navigate legacy financial networks that require days/weeks/months to actually settle payments.

* *I can already do this with my debit card / bank transfer in China/Europe/India/USA*

70% of the population in El Salvador do not have bank accounts or access to any financial services. You are bragging about using a 100% centralized, permissioned system subject to heavy inflation and which can ban you and seize your funds at any time, but that's not what El Salvador and other Latin American countries need. The number of US Dollars in existence has increased by 1000% in the past 10 years. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL

* *Haha and it only cost $20 in transaction fees!*

No, this is a Bitcoin transaction sent via Lightning Network. The transaction fee would have been about 1-2 satoshis, or around 3/100ths of one cent. Also, even without LN, Bitcoin's transaction fees are currently extremely low.

* *Okay well have fun waiting 2 days for a confirmation lmao!*

No, this is a Bitcoin transaction sent via Lightning Network. The transaction is secure as soon as it arrives in a few seconds. There is no need to wait for a confirmation.

* *Yea but Lightning Network is centralized!*

No, it's definitely not! There are [currently](https://1ml.com/) over 20,000 LN nodes and 50,000 payment channels available. Anyone can run their own LN node because it is a decentralized and permissionless protocol. It is also possible to use LN in a custodial fashion for small amounts.

* *But only on-chain bitcoin transactions count as bitcoin transactions.*

A bitcoin transaction is a bitcoin transaction. Bitcoin sent via Lightning Network utilizes multisig and smart contracts that securely and privately transmit payments without actually broadcasting them to the blockchain until counterparties decide to settle their transaction histories to the main chain. This is why LN can operate so quickly and cheaply. 

* *Bitcoin is crashing today so she already lost all her money!*

This video was recorded a couple weeks ago. It's possible that she already exchanged it for fiat or spent it elsewhere

* *Okay okay but my shitcoin can...*

Most people were in that talk, and after it ended a few more trickled in to my room. Also, the few that were there sat in the back near the door, not quite committing to my talk and ready to leave. By the end there were 20-30 people in the last 3 rows. 

I did not find it at all humiliating. I enjoyed giving the talk and then went to watch other talks and mingle with the rest of the people at the conference.

Most people don't buy bitcoin for any of the reasons for it's existence. People aren't buying it for it's political neutrality, it's international scope, it's store of wealth, it's transactability.   


People are buying it because it seems to have been appreciating.   


I love the original ethos of why bitcoin was invented but I think that original concept has been polluted by the same fundamental human factors that plague anything of value- greed.   


It's greed that is driving bitcoin, not a desire for privacy or financial freedom. It's greed that drives the miners to operate. The entire system is a self-perpetuating one that is at the moment entirely built on it's necessary appreciation.   


I will make no guesses where things will go in the future but most people are buying bitcoin just because it is going up. So is DOGE and Ethereum and other coins too. That's why this room is empty... Because he's talking about the aspect of bitcoin that most people totally don't care about.

Many of those NFTs that were sold for crazy high prices were not actually sold to other people. The person who bought those expensive NFTs is often the same person who minted the NFT in the first place. I will explain how whales can easily own very expensive rare NFTs for very little cost. They can just mint an NFT and sell it to them self for $500,000 worth of etһ. They will only lose the small percentage that the NFT marketplace takes and now they own a super rare NFT worth $500k and they will still have most of their etһ because they sold the NFT to them self. And there is a small chance that they might be able to to sell that worthless NFT to some fool who believes that it is actually valuable. Doing this also entices more newbies to mint NFTs in the hopes of getting rich.

Some people are now using flash loans to borrow large amounts of etһ so that they can purchase their own NFTs for extremely high prices and then they pay back the flash loan all in the same block. https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122516/how-a-cunning-trick-made-it-look-like-a-cryptopunk-sold-for-532-million

Here is another example that can be done. You can mint an NFT and sell it to yourself for $1000, then put it up for sale and buy it from yourself again for $1500, and sell it to yourself another time for $2200. Now you can put this appreciating NFT up for sale and try to sell it to some fool who sees it keeps getting sold for more and thinks that it must be valuable.

Have you seen celebrities buying NFTs like jpegs of bored apes for hundreds of thousands of dollars? Platforms like MoonPay are paying those celebrities to claim that they bought those NFTs. Those celebrities didn't really pay anything for those NFTs. Those celebrities actually got paid for receiving those NFTs. You can often look at the blockchain and see that the etһ that was used to buy the NFT came directly from a platform like MoonPay, as is the case with the bored ape NFTs that Post Malone recently ""bought for $700k+""

The current NFTs are useful for something. These NFTs are a useful tool for laundering illegally acquired cryptocurrency. Criminals can shift around their ill gotten crypto between different tokens, mint an NFT, and purchase their own NFT with their dirty crypto. Now they've cleaned their dirty crypto and they also own a rare NFT that's supposedly worth a lot of money. I mean just look at how much it sold for!

It costs anywhere from $100-$600+ to mint an NFT on etһereum depending on the current gas fees and where you mint it. So they're [hyping shitcoiners/artists/anyone up and luring them into minting crap in the hopes of getting rich](https://fstoppers.com/opinion/nfts-are-pyramid-scheme-and-people-are-already-losing-money-554869) and NFTs are doing a great job of that at the moment. People are spending millions of dollars worth of etһereum minting NFTs hoping to hit the NFT lottery and get rich.

**All these NFT tokens being sold on etһereum right now either point to a URL on the internet, or an IPFS hash. In most circumstances they reference an IPFS gateway on the internet run by the same startup that sold the NFT. That URL also isn't the media. That URL is a JSON metadata file.** The owners of the servers have no obligation to continue storing the media. Now let's take a look at a couple of real NFTs and see how they work on a technical level.

https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/1

This NFT token is for this JSON file hosted directly on Nifty's servers as shown below: https://api.niftygateway.com/beeple/100010001/

That file refers to the actual media that was ""bought."" Which in this case is hosted by Cloudinary CDN, which is served by Nifty's servers again. So if Nifty goes bust, this token is now worthless. It refers to nothing and this can't be changed. 

Now we'll take a look at the $69,346,250 Beeple, sold by Christies. It's so expensive. Surely it isn't centralized, right? Wrong, it's pointless: https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924

That NFT token refers directly to an IPFS hash. We can take that IPFS hash and fetch the JSON metadata using a public gateway: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz

So well done for referring to IPFS, it references the specific file rather than a URL that might break! **But** the metadata links to: https://ipfsgateway.makersplace.com/ipfs/QmXkxpwAHCtDXbbZHUwqtFucG1RMS6T87vi1CdvadfL7qA

This is an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com, the same NFT minting startup which will go bust one day.

You might say ""*just refer to the IPFS hash in both places!*"" But IPFS only serves files as long as a node in the IPFS network **intentionally** keeps hosting it. Which means when the startup who sold you the NFT goes bust, the files will probably vanish from IPFS too. [This is already happening.](https://twitter.com/CheckMyNFT/status/1371960028765245440) There are already [NFTs with IPFS resources that are no longer hosted anywhere.](https://twitter.com/scanlime/status/1371509988179464196)

And just pinning the file on your own IPFS node also wont work because the metadata file generally points to a specific HTTP IPFS gateway URL and not the IPFS hash. This means that when the gateway operator goes bust, I can buy the domain and start serving dick pics lol

Right now NFT's are built on an absolute house of cards constructed by the people selling them, and it is likely that every NFT sold on etһereum so far will be broken within a decade. This creates a pretty solid exit plan for makersplace if they run into financial problems. The people who own the these useless NFTs ""worth"" millions of dollars are going to be pretty motivated to buy the site or fund it. Or someone can buy the bankrupt startup domains and start charging NFT owners to serve their files.",1382,2021-12-28 09:50:35,1640706635.0,Bitcoin

So when i buy an nft of an artwork or the first YouTube video. Al thats happening is that my name gets put on a list that should prove ownership.

Buy heres the thing: why should anyone recognize the nft when it comes to ownership? In the real world. The government enforces contracts. Thats what makes them legit. Who enforces nft's? 

If i buy a house and upload a copy online somewhere. Lets say someone makes an nft of the contract. Would the house then be his or hers? Would  the contract not be mine anymore?

(a) Each licensee shall maintain a surety bond or trust account in United States dollars for the benefit of its customers in such form and amount as is acceptable to the superintendent for the protection of the licensee’s customers. To the extent a licensee maintains a trust account in accordance with this section, such trust account must be maintained with a qualified custodian.

  
**(b) To the extent a licensee stores, holds, or maintains custody or control of virtual currency on behalf of another person, such licensee shall hold virtual currency of the same type and amount as that which is owed or obligated to such other person.**

  
**(c) Each licensee is prohibited from selling, transferring, assigning, lending, hypothecating, pledging, or otherwise using or encumbering assets, including virtual currency, stored, held, or maintained by, or under the custody or control of, such licensee on behalf of another person except for the sale, transfer, or assignment of such assets at the direction of such other person.**

&#x200B;

So is RH actually doing what they committed to do when they got their license?  It's a little hard for us to verify the custody.  It is in the Robinhood Crypto User Agreement:

[https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/Robinhood%20Crypto%20User%20Agreement.pdf](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/Robinhood%20Crypto%20User%20Agreement.pdf)

""9. Custody. Cryptocurrencies that I purchase shall be stored and held by RHC in one or more omnibus cryptocurrency wallets for the benefit of RHC customers. RHC shall track the balance and ownership of Cryptocurrencies purchased as part of the RHC Services, and I understand that I can view the balance of Cryptocurrencies in my RHC Account on the Robinhood Platform. RHC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to securely store the private keys associated with my Cryptocurrencies.""

&#x200B;

RH crypto lists all of the states where they have a money transmitter license, together with that state's licensing agency contact info.  I haven't checked out other states' licensing requirements or governing law.

&#x200B;

I wrote RH an e-mail using the support function of the app asking some specific questions about the custody of the bitcoin, their cybersecurity program (another NY state license requirement), and whether they have any insurance against theft or loss of keys.  I know they are not insured by any federal insurance program.  

I chalk it up to my first lesson in ""not my keys not my coins.""  At the moment I am just ""diamond hands"" leaving my BTC on RH, waiting for their reply, avoiding the tax event, and hoping they open up wallet transfers soon.",7,2021-01-30 13:51:00,1612036260.0,Bitcoin

I currently use crypto DeFi wallet but as I accumulate larger amounts will prolly go to Ballet. If you use an exchange I’d go with one that’s based in a country that is unlikely to seize your Bitcoin. There will come a time where governments rally against it and may even seize it in some places. There is precedence for this.

Their IPO is definitely not going to be as high flying as it could have been, but they will survive. Dont forget they have over 35 million members and not all of them are WSB guys. Bad publicity will pull down the number but its not going to vanish. majority dont trade in these hugely volatile stocks with very mediocre fundamentals. 

That said what they did was wrong. They should have limited margin trading or even options for these meme stocks but not stopped trading them all together. That broke the trust. it takes eons to build trust but one bad decision to break them. Still cannot take away what they did for stock investing.

Nodes are what enforce the rules and if some bad actor gained control over a majority of the hash power then nodes would just reject the blocks and wait until another miner submits a valid block and they would collect the block reward and network fees. This is why it's such a big deal that bitcoin nodes can run on a raspberry pi using a basic HDD.

That was in early 2014 and I saw people giving doge coin tips everywhere and I thought I could spend a few bucks too - it seemed fun.

So I tried to get some doge but learned that you could not buy them directly with fiat, only with bitcoin. Ah yes, bitcoin. I had heard about that before but never looked closer. So I did then. Even read the whitepaper. And was soon converted. I forgot all about tipping and doge and instead put a sizable amount of my liquid cash into bitcoin and have hodld since then.  Which has changed my life (well, my financial situation and its impact on my life). Haven't sold a single sat so far - but never tipped any either. 😁",12,2021-02-18 05:17:17,1613647037.0,Bitcoin

relcu2,ho8bo4o,"It seems like a conflict of interest to take away someone’s property without any evidence of wrongdoing, if the proceeds become revenue for your police department. I saw a video where a policeman randomly pulled a man over on the highway, and because he was (legally) carrying $100K, they decided that was too much money for him to have, and therefore it must be ill gotten, and they confiscated it. He broke no laws, answered all questions, and allowed the police to search his vehicle. They had no cause for suspicion or evidence against him. He was dumbfounded when they told him they were confiscating his savings. 

I guess if your department wants some new equipment, all you need to do is find someone with cash and rob them.

Edit- I don’t post links, but if you’d like to see the stunning video I’m speaking of, just search for the following title in YouTube.

They may go lower, but to not take free government sanctioned money is unwise. If you can borrow 500k at 3-4% and make 8 or 50% by holding anything, you are costing yourself over [2 million](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=500000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=64&y=30) or [42 million](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=500000&cinterestratev=46&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=63&y=11) respectively.  This doesn't consider the RE value increase over 30 years.   


Yeah, having a house paid off is nice, but that feeling is just a feeling and it is not a wise financial decision.  If you can manage (good) debt and arbitrage it effectively, not having it is dumb. Use other people's or as the case may be gov backed debt to setup yourself and your family.  This depression area thinking has been hurting people for 90 years and the next generation needs to outgrow that thinking.

nzrzmo,h1r3v8t,">Carbon emissions literally transformed into money.  

No. They're still carbon emissions. Trading isn't a transformation. Let's not get carried away. Creating wealth is the benefit here. Reducing carbon is not.  Perhaps that wealth can enable some carbon efficiencies if used properly, but there is no inherent incentive to do that created here. And there are some negative incentives to continuing the flaring. The social pressure remains however, so there's hope (in addition to the new wealth, both good things which can lead to progress).

= $19.7 billion / year

That's a lot to us, but compared to most industries, this is still really small. And this seems more relevant than energy usage, after all the energy used by Bitcoin *must* be extremely cheap, meaning there are not other high value uses of that energy. 

I suppose it's worth mentioning that all this cost is paid for by Bitcoin users, but clearly that's irrelevant to people spreading the meme. What actually bothers people is that *they don't like Bitcoin* and so any amount of resources used for it are bad.

However... in the next few months there is going to be an EXTREME amount of used cars hit the market which will drive the price of all used vehicles down... maybe even 50 percent.

Hertz is filing bankruptcy and going to liquidate most of their inventory.  Expect Avis, Dollar and Alamo rentals do the same.  Not to mention all those who have not been able to make payments on their cars and will be repossessed.  And this is only the beginning.

We are headed for one of the worst depressions ever because most have no savings.  The whole economic system was destroyed when we took interest rates to zero (in 2009) and punished savers and rewarded borrowers.  There was a time many years ago, before BITCOIN, many had savings accounts, money market accounts, Certificate of Deposits that earned 7 percent annual interest.

nm2185,gzmovgl,"So, to me, this case has a few details worth discussing. This isn't exactly like creating a cake or something, when you receive mined crypto, they have a very definable value at the moment you receive them. But lets assume that the couple here is correct and they don't need to pay tax at the moment they receive the staking rewards. I don't think its necessary to pay income tax on those coins the year you receive them, but the value basis should be recorded and tracked for when you do sell them. 

For example, if you get $100 worth of mined bitcoin, don't pay anything, but track the date and value. Two years later, those coins you received are worth $200 and you sell them. I would think you pay income tax rates (based on your income the year you sell them) on $100 and capital gains rates on the $100 growth. In this scenario, that $100 is kind of like deferred income. A sale of a portion would pay taxes in accordance with those rules with a portion as income tax and capital gains tax.

nm2185,gzntdrh,"People are often offered stock options as part of their compensation package at many companies. This means shares are reserved for them at the current market price, and their ability to purchase those shares at that price is vested over time. It's an incentive to get professionals to stick around for a while.

When they exercise those options they are buying shares at the price specified in the option contract. The current market price is always higher than the option price - only an idiot would exercise options if the option price was lower than the market price. The difference between the option price and the current market price is taxed as regular income. The market price on the day they exercised their options become the basis price for those shares. If they later sell those shares then the difference between the current market price and the basis price is taxed as a capital gain.

Explain to me how this is any different. Cryptocurrency coins are not ""created"". They are acquired as compensation for lending computing power to solving the hashing problem. The amount of computational work required is known (comparable to the option price), while the value of the reward depends on the current market value of the coin (comparable to the market price of the stock). When the cryptocurrency is awarded then income is realized. The miner has been given something of speculative market value. That value would be taxed as regular income by the IRS. If they subsequently sell the cryptocurrency at a profit then the difference would be taxed as a capital gain.

This would be exactly the same if you had a job and were paid in cryptocurrency. It would be taxed as income based on it's value the day you received it, and if sold at a profit then the difference would be taxed as a capital gain.",4,2021-05-27 12:42:42,1622137362.0,Bitcoin

They are providing a service to the decentralized network through staking. By staking their coins, they are providing the service of securing the network and, for this service they are rewarded or compensated with coins. Let’s say you sell your house with a realtor, well in that realtor is also not an employee, they are an independent contractor and you compensate them for providing you with their brokerage service and whatever services they provide to you when selling your home. They most definitely are getting taxed on this compensation from the services they provided (of course proper tax write offs and money maneuvers can mitigate these taxes as any independent contractor or business owner knows) but money earned from providing services is taxable. But what rate were they taxed at? The usd value of the Tezos when they received them? The value of the tezos when they filed? If they paid the tax on them up front and their price went down by the time they filed do they get a bigger refund? Could they potentially owe more when they file if the prices go way up?

for example the idea that if you get a air drop which you might not even know about that you are responsible for tax on that as ordinary income at that time. seems like it should only ever be a taxable event if the owner/receiver actually sells them.

that being said..pay your taxes people. 

If you disagree with an interpretation pay taxes consistent with your interpretation and then if they challenge you you can explain your interpretation and if they disagree you can either pay what they suggest or go to arbitration tax court or whatever it is for a formal ruling. Its no different than other complicated tax situations. Just dont hide stuff and always be consistent in your interpretation to be treated best if you are audited. 

notice they paid taxes and are going to court to request the refund. they didnt not pay.

there are other areas of rulings that dont seem clea ror correct as well. and there is the issue tha tonly congress can actually make tax law and that cryptocurrency is something so differnet that it is incorrect to insert it into tax law created by congress about other types of things whether property or currency. Its clear congress when making prior tax law did not mean it to apply to crypto because crypto wasnt invented yet. Can you apply a tax on apples passed by congress to a basketball? probably better if congress explicit passes a law on basketballl tax if they want it taxed. The fact that congress specifically avoided making taxes on cryptocurrency is instructive in my amatuer opinion. If congress wanted crypto taxed then they should make an actual law specifically naming crypto as the object to be taxed and come up with some rates.

Rich usually have good access to credit instruments and they use those to benefit from inflation. They are the main beneficiaries of the fiat policies. The people hurt most by inflation and interest rate control are middle class. First of all, if interest rate is low, you need more to buy income stream, which directly affects time you can defer having to work, and second, they usually have the most fiat money as a fraction of their total wealth, and, therefore, loose most from inflation",5,2021-05-03 19:58:36,1620089916.0,Bitcoin

I've pointed out several good times to buy since then, but none of them bought any. When the price was low they were worried that it wouldn't go up again. At $30k (which was what... three weeks ago?!) they thought it was too late. Meanwhile I've been buying with any extra money I have, and I have a new moon that I'm shooting for. I'm *still* telling people that bitcoin is cheap at $50k. When it breaks $150k later this year they'll kick themselves yet again for not listening.

I gained access to a PC and in 2013 mined bitcoins when the guards weren't looking, and had to memorize my private key.  Every waking moment I recited that key, between the bombs, the bullets and the roars of Titans.  In 2021, a man called Eren Jaeger attacked our slums, and in the madness I escaped for my life.  This wasn't freedom, I fear I will never be free, but with my private key I do feel closer to freedom.  Eren killed a lot of people that day, and it's not clear if he is a devil or an angel, but don't let this man distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.

Bitcoin changed most of our life’s and it’s going to continue to do so!

I remember when my brother who passed away in 2015 got me into Bitcoin. He said it was going to skyrocket any year now. He made me drop $1,000 for Bitcoin at the time just so I would have it there someday. Little did he know I believed him more than he thought and I was dropping money into Bitcoin weekly and monthly. At the end of a two week period I was putting at least $100 into my Bitcoin pile sometimes upwards of $500. Whatever I had extra for that month instead of going out to the clubs and partying, instead of buying new toys, materialized items that I didn’t need but wanted, I was saving that money and dropping into Bitcoin. For the past 8 years it has treated my family and I better than I would have ever thought, with 2 years steadily adding to my Bitcoin wallet totaling 10 years in the Bitcoin industry.

He sent them 10 dozen eggs by mail as a joke (valued at around $35 at that time) and they didn’t take it kindly.  Took him to court.  He was required by the court to go get a job, to make fiat based income, to pay the “value” of his egg tax and chick tax.  And the kicker was he then also had a “real” income to tax.

Then he got addicted to meth because he just couldn’t take it anymore.  It was a dumb situation.  Government say if you don’t want to pay tax, don’t work, but then they find new ways to say you owe them money anyway.",9,2022-02-08 21:53:01,1644378781.0,Bitcoin

ANYWAY just so people are aware, the citizens of El salvador do not trust the new president. We have been under different governments since the 80s and all of them have been corrupt. Promise the same things and they pretend like things are getting better when they aren't. Many El Salvadoran people are against bitcoin for a few reasons. 1. The main reason is they believe this is just another opportunity for a corrupt president to launder money. 2. Although a lot of citizens have access to cellphones a majority of people still live in rural areas with no internet or modern tech, so the integration of butcoin will only benefit the capital of San salvador along with some coastal tourist regions. 3. A lot of people in El salvador cannot open a bank account or have extreme difficulties being able to open one which will be needed to properly be able to use btc. All in all thencitizens of El salvador do not have faith in the new government at all. People are still getting kidnapped and murdered everyday by the gamgs, the drop in crime rate coincides with the pandemic and NOT the presidents policies. I wish BTC would be the catalyst that will help propel El salvador forward but it looks more like another tool that corrupt politicians will use to their advantage.

The outcome of the block size wars is that BTC should be digital gold, not cash.  This legislation is trying to treat it as cash.  Ever paid your taxes in gold? 

As many merchants try to get onto the lightning network, it may clog up the blockchain and send tx fees skyrocketing.  This will only piss off more merchants who now need to accept BTC and have to pay a huge fee just to onboard to the lightning network.  

It may work for El Salvador, but if a country like Brazil wants to use BTC as cash, I doubt it can scale to that level of activity.

m0v2pe,gqaa0cl,"Well done!  This community always talks about HODLing forever, but Here's how I think about it now:  If its something that I love or something I need, I would consider spending bitcoin.  I treat it like my savings/retirement.  If I had a financial emergency, or a necessary expense that I could not cover with my normal income, I would consider selling some bitcoin to cover it.    If my employer paid me in BTC, my spending habits would probably look a little differently (I would probably spend even less on things that aren't necessary), but I already try to take that approach, and any unbudgeted money at the end of the month gets stored in BTC as a much safer store of value than fiat currency like USD or euro.   Looking back, I regret the times I spent BTC on trivial things because now that BTC value could have been enough to fund non profit orgs that I love, and retire comfortably.     When you believe BTC is the best possible store of monetary energy, it doesn't make sense to trade it for anything else if retaining/growing value is the goal.

nk6vjg,gzbfbaw,"Edit: [Issue #998: This is the opposite of owning the framing by Marty Bent is also a good read on this issue
](https://tftc.io/martys-bent/issue-998/)

This is some weird subversive collusion reminiscent of [the blocksize war \(everyone should read it\)](https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM). more to come.


Dear /r/Bitcoin 

Allow me to use my exorbitant privilege of green stickied comments to make the following rant. This is my personnel opinion only.

To Elon Musk. Fuck You.

~~To Michael Saylor, Fuck You Too.~~

To the Miners Who collude to censor Bitcoin transactions, Have a big, FUCK YOU.

To the idiot miners who go along with the ESG agenda, I encourage you to reconsider.

With some of that rage out of the way, lets get down to the concerns & implications of recent fuckery in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

Setting the scene:

So we got Saylor, he comes in like a bull in a china shop and we freakin love him for it. Gets all that clout and a mass following by plebs who don't know any better about cults of personality in the Bitcoin space (they all get sacrificed in the end). 

Most Ego's in this space get greedy and lose the signal to pump different bullshit. Which is usually fine when they move on to their different projects and leave Bitcoin alone.

But this time, it feels like they are gunning for something at a Bitcoin protocol level, and I'm pissed about it so I'll try my best here to call them out on what I feel is going on.

Then we got elon, that poor tragic soul. He doesn't last long and has started spreading general misinformation these past few weeks on such a subversive level that you wonder if he's trolling or compromised.

Next, marathon patent group and DMG. These fuckers get the bright idea to only include ""OFAC approved"" transactions inside the Bitcoin Blocks they mine. great, you're allowed to do that! Even if it means you lose mining revenue for doing so, and even if it means you still include OFAC violating transactions in your blocks. Hey, at least it's a good headline and gets the regulators hard. fucking idiots.

For any mining pools or operators who are considering this slippery slope, know that it's a bad idea for you and your operation long term. You will not have community support for virtue signaling or appealing to unenforceable regulatory burden, or by lobbying to impose your bullshit standard on other miners. 

Once we start with ""OFAC approved"" blocks, it never ends. You give an inch, you give a mile. This is just the start to a slippery slope of censored Bitcoin transactions.



**So with those three elements (Saylor, Elon, Marathon) and a few other Bitcoin miners all in one room behind closed doors, they decide to form** 

[**A cartel.**](https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1396915803082080256) 



...maybe this was inevitable. But to you few who see what I see and feel what I feel, rage against the dark for you only burn once in this life. 

To [Hut8 Mining](https://twitter.com/Hut8Mining), [Argo Blockchain](https://twitter.com/ArgoBlockchain), [Riot Blockchain](https://twitter.com/RiotBlockchain), [Marathon Digital Holdings](https://twitter.com/MarathonDH), [Hive Blockchain](https://twitter.com/HiveBlockchain), [Galaxy Digital](https://twitter.com/GalaxyDigitalHQ), [Core Scientific](https://twitter.com/Core_Scientific), [BLOCKCAP](https://twitter.com/blockcap), I ask, are you a part of a intelligence agency run mining cartel?

It's a rhetorical question as you can't know the answer to this question. You should be operating under the assumption that such things are possible and proceed accordingly. cautiously. ie, not at all.

For you independent miners who use any of these pools and can switch, do so now, ideally to https://braiins.com/stratum-v2

Sadly, the smiling face is actually an indicator of bad intent.

Someone who is doing interesting stuff, looking out for the ecosystem, etc... doesn't have much reason to glad hand you or coddle your newbie misapprehensions -- more participants are good, but you specifically? Bitcoin will do just fine without you.  Bitcoin is still proving itself to the world, but some people will never be convinced and if if you want to be foolish then no one really has the time to rescue you.

Someone who is out to scam you, to sucker you into holding their bags or promoting their scheme, to use you to undermine other people's efforts and damage Bitcoin?   They absolutely want to be your friend, they *need* your trust, support, and funding.

The flipside is also sometimes true-- the scammers put on warrior garb to pull in victims from people who want to ""fight"" something.  Either way they're just saying whatever they need to say to get people to do what they want.

Of course, there are an enormously number of genuinely nice people who like to help others even when it gains them nothing.  But being visible gets you targeted and attacked by scammers-- better to stay quiet.  The end result is that the scammers have lots of incentives to be extremely friendly or at least extremely visible and little reason not to,  while honest people have little incentive to be friendly and lots of incentive to be largely invisible.",12,2021-04-19 15:44:04,1618865044.0,Bitcoin

Just wanted to throw [this this post I made over 3 years ago out there](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/78gcni/wish_he_had/dou1tm9/) for those people wondering why this is such a hard lesson to learn.

Here's the snippet that is relevant:
>Imagine you've got a decent IT job at $40-50k in 2011. You have $1000 you can throw into this new ""Bitcoin thing that was just reported online as being used to fund Wikileaks while the government is cracking down on Mastercard, Paypal, & VISA payments. You buy 1k BTC worth at $1 anyway and watch it increase to $5. You decide to sell $1k USD because it makes sense to make back some of your money.

>One day you miss the price increase from $5 to $30 and it's fallen back down to $10. Do you buy or sell or hold? The next day it has increased again back to $15, but too bad, you don't get to buy or sell, there was a hack on the only exchange available. They promise they have your funds but the price will open back up at $10 again, do you buy or sell or hold? A few weeks later it has risen to $12 then fallen to $8, do you buy or sell or hold? A month later the number of Bitcoin miners has fallen to $6, do you keep holding? Two months later it's nearing $2, the difficulty has fallen more than 20% from the peak and Wired just released an article about how it was stupid to think any of us could make money ""mining"" with a GPU. In fact, they are right, it's really no longer profitable to mine in 95% of the US and all of Europe. Do you keep holding?

>The answer to all of these questions was ""buy buy buy"" obviously, but it never seemed like the right answer.

**Lesson 2** above hits the nail on the head. Learn about the dollar cost averaging (DCA) strategy and just stick with it and slowly make money. As long as the developers never change the final Bitcoin total of 21 million, you will likely never regret adopting this strategy over a long enough period of time. Since the total number of Bitcoin and its artificial scarcity is the sole reason so many of us got involved in Bitcoin to begin with, it's very likely never to change.",3,2021-04-19 13:55:55,1618858555.0,Bitcoin

The problem is the banks in the modern US economic system that have turned into **gigantafuckingnormous entities** that cannot be allowed to fail, and the US government has to bail them out no matter what risks they take, creating moral hazard.

* Most employers will outright refuse to pay you in cash, so a bank account is forced down your throat",1,2021-04-20 01:15:49,1618899349.0,Bitcoin

The checks are supposed to be for keeping food on your table, your lights on, and your other basic needs.  The local restaurants are getting crushed in a marathon of difficulties, stores are suffering, many businesses have grinded to a halt. The motive of the govt is often wrong, but keeping some money in people's hands is the right thing. If BTC was the only currency/store of value, I'd hope they'd be giving BTC to those who need a safety net to avoid desperation, cold, and hunger. And to avoid cool businesses closing because of an unusually bad year that would be hard to plan for. I'm afraid my favorite comic book store is going to close in NY so if I got a check I'd go and spend some there so that f'n store is there in 5 years. So while getting rich would be very nice consider this, the airdrop of money is MUCH less than many people need. Many people need 2K per month until, say, their catering business picks back up to normal in fall 2021 (hopefully). The US has only seen fit to give a couple of checks and that was barely pushed through congress. Going on and on about how the check would have made more money if it A) Wasn't spent, B) Was used to exit the USD, and C) Was used to ""gamble"" only makes it harder for checks like this to be issued.",10,2021-02-20 07:09:14,1613826554.0,Bitcoin

stnwn9,hx5etau,"Rule #xx of becoming success: Stop talking about it. Just do it and let proof be your success.

""First they will laugh about you, then they will tell that you were lucky, then they will ask you how you did it""

I remember when I was having a drink day at the bar with a friend, when we go suprised by his old friend from ""before he started his success journey"".

This friend told him to fuck off and that he is stupid believing all those ""coaches and scammers"", joked and laughed about him. He went literally crazy over for what someone else is doing with his life (like wtf dude, why you even care what other people do?)

Well, at that day he was very subdued. He couldn't believe that he was actually successful and wanted to start something ""are you now a scammer too?"" and still search for excuses. I mean it couldn't be real that those ""coaches and scammers"" were true, right? Well, it took probably \~60 minutes that he made up his decision on his mind even tho he didn't said anything. Well, after we ended that night close about having an intoxication from alcohol.. he later on called him and asked to join the team.

Conclusion: Don't talk. Just do it. They will come later on or cry all their life long. It's their life, let them do whatever they want, while you have success.

Congratulations to overcome your friends laughter and beliving in your decisions!

If you’re talking about something that your friends aren’t interested in, the conversation will quickly move on. If you’re talking about something they haven’t heard of, they’ll probably express mild curiosity and ask questions. If you’re involved in something they hate and they want to go away, they’ll try and put you off it.

Why would they keep bringing the conversation back to it if they were genuinely disinterested or confident it won’t work? They do it because they feel a need to stop your involvement in it, which is why they’ll attack you until you surrender and pledge allegiance to their way of thinking.

s0jc7i,hs6mce6,"*This is the way.  El Salvador is showing the world how it is done.*

Your move, Biden / Fed.

For those who are looking for other examples of how this has been done with renewables (in the USA, by some in private industry), see [Blockstream's initiative here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ppumon/bitcoin_infrastructure_firm_blockstream_raised/) (also reported on [here](https://blockworks.co/blockstream-and-square-partner-on-solar-powered-bitcoin-mine/)), or [some efforts in Wyoming by others](https://www.accesswire.com/661255/Elite-Mining-Inc-Can-Now-Capture-Flare-and-Stranded-Gas-Due-to-New-Partnership-with-AXP-Energy-Limited).  But if the federal government were smart, it would remove all the legal barriers it has recently put up (including, but not limited, to those anti-crypto provisions enacted with U.S. Congress's so-called ""infrastructure"" bill) and would instead develop its own bitcoin mining and acquisition system rather than encouraging the Fed to keep spewing out more worthless dollar(s).  (If it were up to the administration + Congress, even something like the silver I just gave OP would end up having to be declared by OP and subjected to capital gains, registration, and permitting. We need to rescind the anti-crypto provisions ASAP, folks.)

It is worth noting that El Salvador's monetary policy and current monetary laws don't require people to only use bitcoin, but rather present it as a viable option, and one which is much simpler for people to enter without fear of penalty or reprisal when they utilize it for their purposes, while they can also use the dollar, and have other currencies available to them in financial institutions available for exchange.  It is, in fact, their choice, and a choice they can make without being penalized with capital gains tax while making that choice, and without being subjected to demands they get a permit simply to use a currency of their choice, and without having to be denied the ability to use that digital currency or be scared off of it by overbearing regulators.  It is sad that the level of currency choice and ability to innovate in El Salvador (under the policies and laws now in place there) certainly exceeds that which can be allowed on a federal level in the United States, and only within one State in the U.S., Wyoming, has there been an ongoing multi-year system of development to get State laws adopted sufficient to create a truly pro-crypto regime within the State to really enable a positive and meaningful business climate where the laws are sufficiently friendly for all crypto users, despite the ongoing federal problem with the dinosaurs in U.S. Congress.

Currently, the Boston Fed is pursuing something called ""[Project Hamilton](https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2021/02/how-did-the-feds-digital-dollar-project-get-its-name-project-hamilton.aspx)"" - for a U.S. CBDC - and has been actively hiring for positions to fill roles for that project.  All very interesting, but if the U.S. does not do away with the barriers to innovation that it has recently enacted through legislation, and if it does not itself become comfortable with acquiring and generating bitcoin, then it will simply fall behind other countries that are already realizing the value of doing this.

The next few years will be perilous indeed for the far future of the U.S.A., and countries like El Salvador in Central America could end up being more influential with their monetary policy than the U.S. has if the U.S. continues to lag behind and create further obstacles to innovation and progress, which will simply drive people to look elsewhere for better solutions.

For those here who have commented on El Salvador's crime rate, keep in mind that it has made some improvements and that not so long ago it had emerged from civil war, and entered into a phase in which all participants received a general amnesty (albeit an uneasy one).  A while after my service there was completed, the U.S. had suspended the U.S. Peace Corps program in El Salvador ([the suspension occurred in early 2016](https://www.peacecorps.gov/news/library/peace-corps-el-salvador-program-suspended/)).  But (if all goes well) the U.S. is set to begin the U.S. Peace Corps in El Salvador again in 2022.  This doesn't occur unless both countries agree it should occur (U.S. and El Salvador, in this case) and typically takes years to arrange, and can realistically only occur if the conditions are considered basically safe enough for Volunteers to operate in.  So are there problems there?  Sure, yes, there are some ongoing issues.  Are people able to address those problems meaningfully? Also, yes, sure, that is possible, because improvements have happened over time.  It's interesting to note that the first U.S. Peace Corps Volunteers to return after it gets started again will be [economic development volunteers](https://www.peacecorps.gov/news/library/peace-corps-announces-return-el-salvador/).

nor5qr,h01wjz8,"I have a Scotia account, and they do have a policy that if its over 6000 CASH, the client needs to call it in and give them 48 hour notice so that they can make sure that they have the extra notes on hand.  I have withdrawn, 10K Cash before with zero notice, but they were not happy and pointed out the policy of calling in to for reservations on large CASH withdrawals.

That said, they had no problem with me wiring 150K to Kraken, or 65K USD to Gemini... both wires went through and as anyone who does wires with exchanges knows, took forever for the funds to show in my account, especially because one of the transactions was done before Christmas during the huge crypto rush and Kraken was flooded with wires. (Bank does wire in 24/48 hours, Exchange takes forever to post the amount.)

As for him being a smart guy.  I will say he is far from it.  Every crypto investor knows you do not tell your bank you are buying crypto with the funds.  Not that they can stop you mind you, but why would you want these sorts of problems?  Why would you want the chance of them freezing your account?   

The guy seems a little nuts making that sort of a scene and wanting his 278K in CASH right away and NOW.   The cops probably were called because he was causing commotion inside calling them thieves and such... expecting them to make good on the withdrawal instantly.    

Like I said, this sort of withdrawal would not be a problem if he called it in, they may even have steered him to a branch that actually had that much cash on hand to make the WD.  You just have to know how to talk to people and not think everything is a conspiracy against you.   If he wanted it as a WIRE it would of been done on the spot with zero problems, so the idea that the banks did not want to give him his money is just in his head.

nor5qr,h01ytt9,"Ex-Banking Employee here, I worked for the bank and its regular practice to confirm a lot of things before such a request can be made.

Without satisfying those requirements and if the client also cause a scene or berate the employees, we can take legal action like this to detain or ban the clients from visiting any of the bank branches.

Clients need to:

- Identify themselves with minimal 2 pieces of ID.

- If IDs are not available, must confirm the most recent 10 transactions, and answer Security Questions to make sure Name, DOB, Email, Phone Number and Address History for the past 3 years are in line with what is on file.

- If the client wants to withdraw in Cash and the amount is more than a specific quantity, then they need to place an order for it first.

- If the client does not comply with any of the above and cause a scene, the branch has the authority to ban the client from visiting any of the Bank Branches.

I know it's not cool, but we literally got robbed at gun points before and I don't have enough digits to count the amount of times Fraudsters and Thieves (with other people's IDs & documents) came into our Branch to request a Full Withdrawal.

I wouldn't be surprised if this unfortunate man had to deal with this and went off the rail yelling at the Bank Tellers. Scaring the shit out them and ended up having cops called.

Back in the days, we had people coming in threatening us - from a teenage group saying they will rape my asian colleague because she pointed out one of them was using a fake Quebec Driver License (which it was). To an old dude with a walker saying he will come back to personally shoot me between the eyes because I wouldn't let him redeem his Unredeemable GIC (for obvious reason).

nor5qr,h03pku6,"To be honest this is one of the perks of traditional banks over crypto.

On paper to an educated, technologically literate and informed person, being your own bank via crypto is an extremely good idea. You are in control of your funds and you aren't being either charged or given a pathetically low interest rate while the bank loans out your money profiting hand over fist.

But we are a society that has a large percentage of people who are totally resistant to learning how to use technology. We can't expect boomers to bank themselves because they live in a simplified world. 

A good example is how boomers pretend you can go get a job out of highschool and buy a house and provide for your family and the only thing standing in our way is expensive coffee and iPhones. 

For boomers who are totally gullible and live like trustafarians by selling the house they bought working at mc Donald's for 2.5 mil in today's market banks are an important level of protection from Nigerian princes and long lost ""family"" they literally have ZERO understanding of how the connected world works or how to manage their finances. 

Banks are far from obsolete, I hate banks and I hardly keep any funds in banks but that's because I grew up with both parents working in computer programming and I had internet access since I could read and type. Even many of the early millennials I know just a few years older than me (28) aren't technologically literate enough to be their own bank via crypto. 

We're just now seeing crypto on the fringe of the mainstream, I do believe that crypto and stateless global currency will prevail once the masses understand it but we are farrrrrr from that point. Hell I'd wager that the majority of people who hold crypto could not explain what blockchain is and why bitcoin has value, they saw it on the news and heard about kids getting rich and said ""yolo I'll buy some bitcorns""",4,2021-05-31 12:38:17,1622482697.0,Bitcoin

Ok, not everyone is a huge fan. Your BTC holdings are gonna vary greatly depending on your attitude to risk and general belief in crypto. 

But *absolutely zero* holdings in something that's been around for 12 years already and gone from zero to $65,000 per unit? Irrational. Especially if you're holding anything like bonds or tools to hedge against inflation or financial crashes.

lvx80u,gpeqjp2,"I remember reading an article, long ago, titled “The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin.” It detailed how the crypto had trudged along at a few dollars per coin, finally rising all the way up to $25 before crashing down to $9. People who bought at $25 lost money, poor souls.

Nowadays, the rise and fall comes in waves of thousands of dollars. Thousands. SMH. Five years from now, the waves might be in the tens of thousands.

I put 50% of the cash I had in crypto - around $8k. I bought lots of altcoins & everything that my friends recommended. ETH price was at $500. Things looked awesome, and there wasn't a hint that things could go south.

It did.

2 weeks in, all the prices when down to shit. I lost 80% of my investment, and had around $1.5k left.

What did I do?

I deleted the app from my phone to stop looking at the prices as I would only get angry at it.

I forgot about it completely until 4 months earlier this year, when I started seeing news all around crypto. I looked up at my portfolio and now it was worth $20k.

During these 2 years, I was hustling my ass off acquiring skills to make $. Now I put $200k into crypto and it's almost double already. Guys. This is not a short-term investment. Buy it, and leave it. Delete all the apps that are tracking the performance of it and don't watch the news.

In the meantime - learn how to make $ so that you can keep reinvesting it back into crypto or elsewhere.

Starring [Chevy Chase](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000331/) (aka ""Pierce Hawthorne"" from *Community*) in his prime, the film documents the Griswold's disastrous road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles to visit Wally World, a Disneyland-like theme park (filmed at [Six Flags Magic Mountain](https://www.sixflags.com/magicmountain)). 

This clip, for those of you youngsters on /r/Bitcoin, includes [John Candy](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001006/), another comic genius of the 80s and 90s, taken from us far too young. Candy starred in *Trains, Planes, and Automobiles, Splash, Stripes, Cool Runnings, Uncle Buck,* and countless other films, and had memorable cameos in *Home Alone* and this film. 

Also in this clip is [John Hughes](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000455/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)\-favorite [Anthony Michael Hall](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001309/), who absolutely crushed it in [*The Breakfast Club*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088847/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0), among other films.

Then it’ll crash again, maybe this winter: not going below 10k but still massively bumming people out... this’ll last a few months before it picks up again and the cycle continues.

BUT, remember things like diversification and your specific investing PLAN. When will you get in? How much? When will you get out? How much is enough gain? How much is enough loss? BTC, whether a “good” start or not, is providing many young investors with their first experience in the market.

nc84sv,gy5281z,"I think the richer you are the less you know about bitcoin since it has no appeal to you, it offers you nothing, you don’t need it, so you don’t desire to understand it. Meanwhile some poorer people (or more middle class idk) are actually interested in it. This explains Elon musk inability to understand why bitcoin specifically, of all tokens, is the superior allocation at the moment. Elon simply is not in touch with any actual market. He exists removed from the market networks, people buy things for him and he has purchasing managers, he doesn’t interface with any of the actual monetary networks. He doesn’t buy things he doesn’t sell things, people buy and sell things for him, so he simply does not understand much about money. 

The understanding of markets is something that eludes many highly intelligent people, it’s not something we should’ve ever expected Elon musk to understand. His perspective isn’t one where he would see the appeal of bitcoin. To him it’s arbitrary essentially because he’s not familiar with how money really works. He’s highly intelligent, it’s just that his intelligence is focused on things like physics engineering and coding, not markets or investing or resource management or resource efficiency. His money comes from his family who made their money mining. He’s an industrialist, he’s very good at what he does, and what he does is running factories. He’s not someone who understands monetary networks. In his eyes, I think, money is made by making things. Not by investing. This explains his sort of irrational and hard to understand/explain investment habits. He’s just not an investor or finance guy. He’s a.. maker of objects. He deals with 3 dimensional meat space not strategic resource allocation. He’s good at what he does his lack of precision in this area isn’t a character flaw he’s just human.

There really was a time that you could make a decent living if you were willing to work. There was a time when economy actually worked and made sense ...


Now it doesn't. You are expected to work unreasonable hours for a very small wage, which barely covers simple necessities.


In the 80s an uneducated carpenter would wake up at 8, eat breakfast with family, grab his lunch box, and walked to work while smoking a cigarette. He worked until 3 in the afternoon, got home, spent time with his family.


He could afford a house, a car, and raising 4 kids just on that salary. 


Now you are expected to have multiple degrees and alot of experience in the field, long work hours, covering multiple duties, your wife has to work too and you would still spend most of your life in debt. If you're lucky, you'll have your debts paid off in your 60s.

However, as a business, this is something that Huobi has intentionally made it very difficult to accomplish for you.

In order to recover these funds, someone at Huobi will need access to the private key associated with the BTC address.  They will then need to take the BTC funds that are accessible with that key and send them somewhere for you.

Think about what that means for a moment.

In order to guarantee security of your funds, Huobi has intentionally made it very difficult for any individual in their company to access any of the private keys.  That way, individuals in the company don't need to be trusted not to steal their customer's funds.  You are asking them to break their own security model.  Whomever accesses the private key for you would be able to access other private keys as well, and theoretically could steal funds.

The first is that it put to rest criticism that Bitcoin's Hash Rate is too concentrated in an authoritarian country where human freedoms are not respected.

Secondly, it also raised Bitcoin's ESG score, with the share of renewable energy in the electricity used by Bitcoin having climbed well above 50% since then.

Bitcoin does not need China to succeed in its revolution.

China will regret this decision, and may even regret it already when we read in the last few days that the Chinese Communist Party is consulting the population on whether Bitcoin should be allowed again...

Consider excusing yourself from this sub until after the bull has run it's course or your stress levels are going to go through the roof over the next 6-9 months! This place was filled with absolute twat-bandits in the previous cycle. As the price goes (waaaay) higher, nob-tards will come over from the dregs of Reddit and ruin the sub once again. Apologies if you were around to see it last time already but it should be expect to be fair.

The best thing about this sub, and r/CryptoCurrencies to an extent, is using the general feel of the subs to get a retail perspective of the market. I scooped up a whole lot of BTC (for my fiat budget) when the subs were filled with dread and 'crypto is dead' chatter. Worked out very nicely indeed, for me. It's exactly the WSB retards and reckless folks that are best to watch for an overall retail sentiment.

Now might be the time. The world is slowly going from “I feel like the system is rigged against me” to “holy fuck it really is rigged”. 

This event is going to kick start crypto in a way we’ve never seen possible. People are going to buy in hard. Not because they are speculating and want to get rich quick, but because they are scared of all the fuckery going on in the markets and want to protect their wealth.

This seems like a cool ass sub with level headed people. Think I’ll buy in and stay. Now convince me why it’s not a good idea to rip 500k into dogecoin.",220,2021-01-31 09:32:22,1612107142.0,Bitcoin

The sentiment there is if you mention Bitcoin you get a Swift auto mod correction and post removed. 

However! The wokening is happening. 💎 I am a value investor who found Bitcoin a long time ago. 🙌

This event has causes a large eye opening event to occur and I believe it’s only hastening the Hyperbitcoin we’ll love to see. 💎
Bitcoin hodling is the most impervious form of diamond hands. The skills you gain from watching 80% corrections make you fiat immune. 

I’m proud to be apart of this movement and I think we’re all wanting to work together to fix this system.

We, the coiners, are doing what we do. Shorting the USD and using the worlds best currency. 
We, the WallStreetBets, are using our ape minds to expose hedge funds doing illegal s**t and will maybe even try to tank the market instead of fixing their mistake. Either way, it’s an assault on two fronts. 

Any $GME gains I obtain will be directly put into cold storage. It’s nice seeing this, thank you.

l9cw5p,glionac," Thank you all, now I know what the inbox blowing up feels like.  I feel like there are particular lines of questioning from the autists that is easier to address with a giant edit.  So here you go (I can't bring myself to call you retards, sorry).

We have an ongoing debate here about custody as Bitcoin shares that same property of gold, where you can take personal responsibility over it by holding it yourself.  Which also means it can be stolen from you or you can lose it through your own mistakes.  Some of us have been here a long time and forget the anxiety that comes with making that first big on chain transaction.  So, while I want everyone to know how to use a hardware wallet and seed phrase, having spent two decades in IT support, I realize that isn’t realistic for everyone.

**For the people that want maximum control over their Bitcoin (ie. Being your own bank):**

If you feel intimidated, that’s natural, we were all newbs once.  Start small, don't just buy a Trezor or Cold Card then transfer everything to it.  Transfer a small amount, wipe it out and restore it with your seed phrase a few times.  Ie. Spend hours playing with the tech before you start going big and trusting it with any significant amounts of your savings.  Ask questions whenever you start to feel lost, but **NEVER EVER** trust any person or website that asks for your seed phrase or private key (it’s always a scam).

**For the people that don’t trust themselves with the tech:**

That’s ok too, don’t let anyone make you feel like you aren’t doing it right.  Just know we are all about learning here, so we will continually encourage you to try (some more aggressively than others).  For many of us self custody is the point, as once you can do this no one can stop you from using your Bitcoin.  While if you have a custodian, the custodian can stop you (just like Robinhood is the custodian of its ~~victims~~ clients stocks).  I differ from the common sentiment here on this, as I see some benefit to custodians in some situations, but would still love it if you try to learn over time.

You'll find many of us don’t like Coinbase for philosophical reasons that I don’t want to waste keystrokes getting into.  But, odds of them going broke and just taking everyone’s crypto are rather low IMO.  I, personally, like the custodians that pay interest (Celsius, BlockFi, and Nexo), even though there are plenty of other OGs here that consider that a horrible idea.  If you have money in a retirement fund you are probably limited to something like GBTC (Greyscale) where it is a publicly traded fund backed by a giant hoard of BTC.

My only big piece of advice to people that want a custodian would be to pick a few custodians that allow you to withdraw your bitcoin directly, rather than just one.  This also gives you the option of withdrawing from one directly into another.  When you withdraw Bitcoin directly from any custodian (like Coinbase) they will ask you for an address (That foreign looking long string of letters and numbers), if you use the deposit address from another service you are getting those custodians to make an on chain transaction for you.  ALWAYS triple check those addresses when you do this.

&#x200B;

Lastly, for those of you that want good resources to learn from, these are my favorites:

[Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWCJCWOxBYSi5DhCieLOLQ) (Our OG hero, second only to Satoshi)  His recent video comparing Bitcoin to flying in airplanes does a phenomenal job of explaining why we can be so fervent about key ownership.

[Ivan on Tech](https://www.youtube.com/user/LiljeqvistIvan) \- good source for learning about different altcoins

l9cw5p,gliywlk,"Longtime follower of both subs here.  I am seeing lots of commingling lately, and that's a good thing.  

One common misconception in the crypto subs is that this short squeeze has already happened, and that the Mortal Kombat uppercut to the hedgies has already been given.  

It has most certainly not.  There is absolutely zero evidence that they have closed their shorts at all.  One of our WSB retards has a site up that makes this easy to track for everyone: 

http://isthesqueezesquoze.com/

Once the hedgies start closing their short positions (effectively buying the stock back), we will be seeing buying power equal to 120% of the total shares that exist.  This should be quite a show.  

Once this happens, many of the holders of GME will be coming into crypto with lots of new greenery.  But until then, we need help!  The more holders of GME who don't sell out early, the higher the hedgies will need to go to get back their shorts.  We can effectively name our price if we hold.  All the newcomers who want to jump in and stick it to them are appreciated, but its important be educated on how crazy of a situation this actually is.  It's unprecedented.  

So definitely stay long on Bitcoin, but in the meantime pick up a pitchfork and a torch and hold some GME and keep it out of the hands of the these bastards until they break.

Regulation will be a massive win for the crypto space. Why? Because it makes it significantly easier for institutional players to invest. I don't mean trade, as hedge funds are already doing so. I mean invest into, or hold onto their balance sheets alongside cash. Not to mention integrate into their business models. 

It sounds as if he truly believes blockchain could solve a lot of the problems in the financial sector. Yes, he taught at MIT, but let's not forget that he also came from an almost 2 decade career at Goldman Sachs and was their co-head of Finance, leading their global Treasury department. With his background and experience, he knows the exact pain points of the Finance world, and believes that blockchain can solve a lot of them. I believe his focus won't be on banning cryptos or anything like that (I mean, come on, he was the reason why Bitcoin futures exist today), but how to make it easier for companies to embed and integrate blockchain technology into their current ecosystems.

If long-term hodlers have been able to purchase property thanks to the price appreciation of property they'll know it's more tax efficient to buy in fiat due to capital gains. Thats why we need to fight against tax on crypto.

You sold something that's growing 200% every year for something that might, if you're lucky, grow by 3% every year, when you could have used historically cheap fiat USD to do so instead.

This is the ADDCO portable sign. Today, you see what is on the inside, and how they are programmed to display important information.

The access panel on the sign is generally protected by a small lock, but often are left unprotected. Upon opening the access panel you can see the display electronics.
The black control pad is attached by a curly cord, with a keyboard on the face.
Programming is as simple as scrolling down the menu selection to ""Instant Text"". Type whatever you want to display, Hit Enter to submit. You can now either throw it up on the sign by selecting ""Run w/out save"" or you can add more pages to it by selecting ""Add page""

** HACKER TIPS ** Should it will ask you for a password. Try ""DOTS"", the default password.

In all likelihood, the crew will not have changed it. However if they did, never fear. Hold ""Control"" and ""Shift"" and while holding, enter ""DIPY"". This will reset the sign and reset the password to ""DOTS"" in the process. You're in!",6,2021-08-22 14:15:12,1629659712.0,Bitcoin

He points out a concern of his in regards to Bitcoin and suspenses transactions until more mining is used with renewable energy, and says Tesla won't sell their Bitcoin which shows they see the need to have it. His main problem was some fuel power plant was brought back online to mine Bitcoin. His mission is to accelerate the world to sustainable energy so seeing a headline like that doesn't fit the company's mission. Granted the guy isn't perfect and neither is Bitcoin. He wants Bitcoin to be better in that regard, how can things improve without trying to address the issue? Full disclosure, I love Tesla the company and I love Bitcoin, I own both. But Elon coming out against the energy usage didn't change my long term outlook for Bitcoin. Eventually things will get better but people should learn to take criticism and not take things so personally.

rg2qxi,hoih2rq,"Early whiskey distillers were confused when they cracked open an aged barrel, only to find that some of their whiskey had disappeared. Every time, the same thing, the same amount. What was going on? Surely this could only be the work of Satan?  

We know now that this was due to transpiration: alcohol moving through the wood fibers like water up a tree trunk, and then evaporating. But distillers still refer to this loss by its original name: the Devil's Cut. Every year, it's responsible for the loss of more than 110 million liters of whisky in Scotland alone. 

Your wife has delivered her Devil's Cut of Bitcoin—the small but necessary losses that keep the rest of the barrel tasting so good.

Edited to note: The ""Devil's Cut"" specifically refers to the whisky absorbed by the porous barrel. There's also what's known as the ""Angel's Share,"" which refers specifically to the amount that leaves the barrel altogether through evaporation. I think lost bitcoin is more comparable to the Devil's Cut, because technically it's still there—it's just impossible to do anything with it.

Original article: https://www.coincenter.org/bitcoin-taxation-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it/

Excerpt:

*In its March 2014 guidance, the IRS announced that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are treated as property, which means gains from sale or exchange are taxed as capital gains rather than ordinary income. This is good because capital gains rates are generally lower than tax rates on ordinary income. However, unlike traditional government-issued currencies, property does not enjoy a de minimis exemption.*

*This is in contrast to how foreign currencies are treated, which do enjoy an exemption. Say you buy 100 euros for 100 dollars because you’re spending the week in France. Before you get to France, the exchange rate of the Euro rises so that the €100 you bought are now worth $105. When you buy a baguette with your euros, you experience a gain, but the tax code has a de minimis exemption for personal foreign currency transactions, so you don’t have to report this gain on your taxes. As long as your gains per transaction are $200 or less, you’re good to go.*",13,2021-06-06 11:27:00,1622996820.0,Bitcoin

""Bitcoin has ... become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism,"" Francisco Blanch, a commodity and derivatives strategist, said.

Let me tell ya, I've been tracking bitcoin since 2013.. finally pulled the trigger and been hodling since july 2017..... this is very very similar but not really to Dec 2017/Jan 2018... only difference is there's no news, there's no aunt calling me for advice, there's no mother in law asking me what is bitcoin, there's no coworkers asking me if i know about this bitcoin thing... 

This time it feels different. I got PTSD for real, because I've seen this popping so many times but the recent news from Paypal, Square, Grayscale leads me to believe this is definitely a little bit more concrete. We might be witnessing the solidification of Bitcoin as a contender asset to store value. :)

1. It might be useful to have a certain amount backup in fiat money. In case you have some damage, insurance claims, etc. your fiat pot levels it out and you can keep your coins longer. 

2. Investors usually spread the risk over different assets to reduce risk perhaps you can look out for company stock where you could invest a portion.

o21d0p,h249454,"Hey congrats to you for working hard, diligently saving and making the transition to best monetary system ever created. It will change your life. 

I haven’t read all the comments but just want to ad a few things I’ve learned from taking the bitcoin plunge myself in late 2019:

1) Consider sinking half of your total investable capital in lump sum and then DCA-ing the other half over 6 months or so. This market is short-term volatile and DCA helps dampen the swings. I personally give myself a weekly allotment of fiat to buy bitcoin with then try to always buy in the red. If it dumps -10% or more I double up on my buy.

2) I hold 2/3 of my stack in cold storage and 1/3 in Celsius’ interest bearing wallet. If you get 3500 satoshi’s per day compounded daily, over time this adds up. I think about like: .000035 at a 1 million dollar bitcoin is $35 in fiat purchasing power. Getting that every single day for years on end could be a powerful source of passive income and a way to passively grow your stack. It’s also a good way to be able to tap into the liquidity of your bitcoin in an emergency without selling. 

I know “not your keys not your coin” but to me the small risk (I haven’t heard of one person losing their coins to a major player like Celsius) is well worth the potential reward. Totally your call (obviously) but I think it’s worth mentioning as compound interest can be a game changer especially with an asset like bitcoin that does so well to protect and amplify purchasing power over time. 

3) Safe storage of keys! Everyone’s life situation is different so I can’t recommend a one-size-fits-all SOP for key storage but I will just say, don’t overlook this part of being a HODLer. Make sure no matter what *you* can access a “forever” copy of your keys somehow. 

4) Keep learning about bitcoin. This space is evolving at a crazy pace - keeping up on things is beneficial. I can’t tell you how much I’ve learned in the 18 months since I arrived. It’s definitely deepened my convictions and made HOLDing and accumulating a serious priority instead of a “gamble”. Nothing is certain, but I feel more confident in bitcoin’s trajectory than ever before. 

5) Be careful who you tell about your investment and FUCK the haters. Bitcoin is widely disparaged and misunderstood by the majority of the population. A huge number of people will make confident proclamations about bitcoin when they really have no fucking clue what they’re talking about. No facts. No nuance. Just cheap rhetoric. 

This is another reason to continually learn. I can spot the 2014 FUD boys from a mile away. They mostly say the same tired shit but I kid you not these types genuinely believe they *know.* This arrogant attitude usually stems from a Bloomberg headline they glanced at 3 years ago but somehow that gives them enough confidence to have closed the case on bitcoin. It’s pathetic… Either shred them or ignore them but know they are coming. Unless of course you keep to yourself about bitcoin.  

Good luck to you sir.",46,2021-06-17 13:16:44,1623953804.0,Bitcoin

v3y61y,ib19k1t,"The comparisons are flawed though. We need a currency to pay for things, not as an investment. BTC and other cryptos are now only used to make money. And right now, it favours those who already have a lot of money. This is the first fundamental flaw. The second one is that a currency that is used to pay for things should idealy be stable. If you would only use btc now, you may be richer in the future if you save that money. But you can't afford to loose half your money in a dip when you depend on it.

If everybody used btc, like people wish, it's won't be deflationary anymore. Sure, btc will stay limited in ammount and some of it will get lost over time. The value of a btc will rise compared to a dollar. But that doesen't make it more valuable when everybody uses it. Your 1 btc is now worth twice as much, but since it is the default currency, it can only pay for half as much. The buying power stays roughly the same, otherwise everybody would become rich. Meaning, if btc would become a currency as popular as the dollar, it would start to inflate in purchasing power. Inflation describes the purchasing power of money, not it's arbitrary value. And it isn't only caused by an increasing money supply.  It happens because the goods get priced higher, not because the currency looses value compared to itself.

This isn't the fundamental problem of bitcoin, the dollar or our financial systems. But a problem of our human behaviour and greed that causes it. Bitcoin and other cryptos like we have them now won't fix that.

There are many good resources about all that. Inclusing some easy to understand youtube videos. But I assume ctypto enthusiasts are aware of all that and not actually the ones making those posts.

Im thinking out to the year 2100 where the block reward is insignificant but the aggregate transaction fees are massive because the entire worlds corporations and nation states are using on chain transactions. 

Governments would be able to get paid based on the entire worlds economic activity not just their own citizens, this means it would be counterproductive to slow another nations economy down because that would reduce their overall revenue being earned through mining. Instead all governments would benefit from all other nations doing better and whichever government holds the most hash power will have the largest revenue stream.

For example, back in the day [I tipped .1 Bitcoin to an SMF dev that never accepted it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nmdq4/bitcointalk_hacked/#cck814j). 

Later, I [tipped 1 full BTC to someone that was downvoted for being critical of ASICMiner](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1i0lxt/asicminer_weekly_dividend_002075485_bitcoins_per/#cazuyfx), a company that would one day rip off all their investors. My donation was downvoted almost immediately I remember, but looking back on it, apparently later on it got enough upvotes to go positive. The poster made a really good observation about return on investment at a time when people were being delusional about ASICMiner's credibility and capability to retain it's high spot in the Bitcoin ecosystem. I felt like a reality check was needed and don't regret the tip for a second.

I apparently made a [top ten tippers list back in the day for that one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ip3ca/top_10_tipperstippeessubreddits_of_last_1000/). 

And finally, no, I don't have BTC that I want to tip with today. :/ I guess maybe I've gotten a bit more critical and stingy with my donations, and of course I don't have the BTC like I used to.

g09r7v,fnbb4zf,"It's been a little while since I've frequented these subs, but everyone in here seems to be giving you advice and much of it is extremely subjective.  


Yes, hard wallets and cold storage are the MOST secure ways to store your BTC.  They're also some of the more complicated and despite everyone's absolute certainty about them, there are risks involved with trusting companies like Ledger and Trezor as well.   


That said, there is value to getting if off the exchange, it's something I chose to do with most of my crypto back in 2017, but sites like Coinbase and Binance claim to insure both your crypto and fiat, are much simpler to use than a hardware wallet.  They also employ much better security protocols than Magic The Gathering's Online Exchange (MTGOX) did in 2015, and even in the winter of 2017/2018 Coinbase was never hacked.  


Congrats on getting a fully coin!  If you were able to trade your way to that position during the past couple of years then you're doing something right and I trust you'll make good decisions.",4,2020-04-13 16:13:34,1586812414.0,Bitcoin

g09r7v,fn8yj4t,"Best thing to do:  

Run a livecd of Tails OS.  
Fire up electrum.  
Create a new wallet and write down your 12 word seed phrase.  
Pop in a new usb and save a receiving address and the master public key to a text file on it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqbXCViEBTg

Remove the usb, Shut down the computer.  

Power your computer back up normally.  Install electrum on it. Set up a new watch only wallet with the master public key you saved from before.  This is just for viewing so if you get hacked and someone steals the master public key, you're fine.  

Send .02 bitcoins to the receiving address from coinbase.  If you see it go through in electrum then send the rest.  

Go here and write down the corresponding numbers to your seed phrase.  https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt  

Buy these things from Amazon:  

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077CYKHZ6  
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00433SC4Q  
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XCZ3TDG  
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CO8DIM 

Punch the corresponding numbers into the titanium.  Make sure you get the order of the words right.  

Burn the paper you wrote the seed phrase and corresponding numbers on.  

Hide the titanium plates somewhere in your house that is safe.  

Bonus points if you use openssl to encrypt your seed phrase in a file with a good shared secret, save that file to usb from the live cd and store that usb in a safe deposit box at a bank.  Or, just encrypt the wallet itself using the feature in electrum with the password: grandmaprovidesforhergrandchildren  Rename it to grandma.jpeg.  Put that along with a bunch of other jpeg files on the usb disk.  Tell your children to remember grandma provides for her grandchildren.

kkjpdn,gh2x9zp,"I know this is gonna sound so corny but this made me tear up a bit - likely because im a total Interstellar nerd. But it just really hit me - after the last 2 almost 3 years now, all my chucking money into BTC was worth it. I was right. Felt nuts pouring money in at 3k, and many told me so equally.

Every family event I was the 'financial joke' in a sense - 'you keep investing in that bitcoin how come you arent retired yet? When you gonna buy grandma and I a car with your big money? This time next year you should've finally made your money right?' Suddenly, radio silence. And If I mention Bitcoin everyone gets all happy and excited - since weve passed 20k grandpa can't stop showing me every lotto winner - even if its $2 on a $5 card. Some sort of rationalization.

I've won. And this is, hopefully, STILL just the start of that winning journey. It's so worth it and, at 25, has given me an amazing financial cushion store mostly in assets the government can't directly inflate.

Don't underestimate this GIF and the connection of BTC > Interstellar. In a sense, We ARE trying to save the world - most people just don't know it. Whoever controls the money, especially if it's printable fiat currency, controls the people and the entire prevailing system.

While your average citizens has not realized the financial war being waged, the US and other governments have. Hence the KYC regulation, chainalysis and proposed private wallet regulations. You know it IS a real battle when the US Gov is fighting back - yet almost as quietly as possible so as not to wake up the populace. Instead of trying to 'take down BTC' traditionally, or via a chain attack, it is being done by integrating it into current systems and over-regulating it.

The world was supposed to bend to Bitcoin, Bitcoin was not supposed to bend to the world. There is still time but many won't wake up until the reality is on their doorstep. Or rather a lack of funds available to order Doordash to put food on the doorstep. Only then, maybe, will your average person at all start considering monetary theory - when it finally affects them.",166,2020-12-26 10:21:04,1608999664.0,Bitcoin

woib5s,ikcuy2x,"As a person in their sixties, I can tell you that it has actually gotten even worse than the charts suggest due to a lot of hidden costs. 

For instance, owning a used car back in the seventies was really easy. I worked as dishwasher for about two weeks at $2.50/hour  and I bought a 1964 Dodge Dart $200. No payment plans (since it was so cheap) and no mandatory insurance. We (my parents often borrowed it) drove that car for years all over the USA without doing any maintenance.

In 1980, I bought a Ford Pinto for $1000. While it needed some maintenance over the years, everything could be done by hand. I pulled the head one day, removed the valves and springs, sent it to be magnafluxed and cleaned, had it back five hours later, and reinstalled it that night.

Around the same time, my co-worker had problems with his Chevy. The automatic transmission was slipping in some gears and I offered to help him. In one night after work, we bought new friction plates on the way to his house, removed the transmission, replaced the plates, reinstalled the transmission, drove it, discovered some gears weren't working, removed it again, discovered that I misplaced one of the tiny ball bearings in the hydraulic control circuit, corrected it, reinstalled the transmission, everything worked fine.

Rear wheel drive and the lack of tons of emission controls made all this possible back then. There was a local shop that would do complete transmission overhaul for just $100. Usually the same day too. A few years ago, when the transmission on my sister's Volkswagen Rabbit died, I couldn't find someone willing to do it for less than $3000. It was cheaper to just buy another used car. 

And this rant is just about the increased costs of owning a car, there are new problems with education, jobs (hidden costs that drastically reduce your take home income), and even home ownership.",82,2022-08-15 02:52:15,1660549935.0,Bitcoin

We’re told to save, put in 401k and when it’s done expect a 5% Roi. And live happily ever after. None of those things pan out. In the end the only thing that remains true is that the rich will continue to advance from the people to do their dirty work.. and they will tell us whatever to keep us in that box so they can continue to have somebody to do the dirty work. The market isnt dangerous. The markets are profitable. And they’re not even hard or complicated.
In fact with just simple mathematics and a little common sense one can a mass of fortune. 

Im new to  crypto. In Fact I’m new to investing. I always use the excuse that I didn’t have the money. When it was actually that same thought process that was keeping me from making it. I left my job 27 years as a certified automotive technician. Just seven  months ago. My daughter left home after 16 years of raising her by myself and taking care of many other family members friends etc. My worry was always if I took a chance and failed how do I look them in the face. Now I wish I would’ve done it sooner. 
 
After seven months as a entrepreneur/new investor.I have a double what I made year prior. I jumped into stocks from cash app LOL three months later I was in options on Robin Hood in the last four months I’ve done some things that a lot of people don’t even believe possible. Including to get TDA who was sure that i somehow cheated system. Lol. 

The road is anything but smooth. Anything but easy. anything  but free  from struggle and surely not without extreme challenges. Only with determination and perseverance will you succeed.

Like anything else one will need to study. will need to put in work and will need to manage risk and use good judgment. A person will have to be patient and remind himself constantly of why they do it. that being said there’s nothing liberating than teaching yourself skills that you can use in any market in any situation and circumstance. Learning these skills that are really applicable anywhere. It’s crazy to me how you go into somethingThinking you’re learning one thing but in actuality you might be there for a whole different  purpose. 
Or those skills that you set out to teach yourself we’re only a small part of the overall picture and plan of what god had in store fir you. Trust the process. I haven’t made it there yet I’m surely on my way

So why the heck are they not attacking those facts??
 If your own gold what good does that do?? If you owned a lot , you'd pay storage fees.If stored in your own custody. In your own residence you run then risk of losing your life . People from all over would be trying to rob you..especially the people they are keeping in poverty  with no food! You can't eat gold.. Put a wheel barrow full of gold in front of a starving person . Then put a plate of food in front of them.. What would be chosen? The heavy gold that is just heavy and hard to carry around,  plus the burden of having to look over your shoulder constantly in fear of being shot or killed being robbed?..Or the plate of food that satisfied the hunger , gives nutrition and energy to a body to survive? 
Most people do not even know that feeling..believe me you will, if you choose the gold . People will become desperate to feed there children and themselves ..when the vote is NO to raise the min. wage  to help hedge against the inflation .

Also, most exchanges do more than just interact with the crypto network; they interact with the banking network.

pr7fow,hdih6cg,"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace  
by John Perry Barlow   
Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.  
  
We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.  
  
Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.  
  
You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.  
  
You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.  
  
Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.  
  
We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.  
  
We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.  
  
Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.  
  
Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.  
  
In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.  
  
You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.  
  
In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.  
  
Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.  
  
These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.  
  
We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

1 friend bought because of greed. 1/10 research.

1 friend researched and is dca'ing.

Parents bought some, heavily researched.

6/100 took a plunge. 1/100 has a significant amount of net worth int it.

The few BTC that I mined back then, I lost it all under unbelievable circumstances. Until today I don’t know how was this possible.

In Nov/Dec 2010 I emailed the first BTC exchange (owned by a guy nicknamed libertarian) to buy some BTCs. On that time you could buy about 1500 BTCs with only a dollar. He asked for my address but I didn’t reply him because my PayPal account had zero balance and I couldn’t use PayPal in my country back then.

Fast forward to 2018, I lost 90% of my savings to a crypto scam introduced by a friend of mine. I convinced my gf to resign from her job as the interest rate I received was able to pay her a salary. After only 2 months, all investment were gone, stopped receiving interest and no more income from her job.

The world crashed on me really, really hard. White hair was popping all out from my head and I aged 10 years older in a short span of time.

But... I never had any thoughts of killing myself although I felt and still feel the pain you are talking about. And I believe I will feel it throughout my whole life.

I think this is because I never wanted to be a millionaire. I only want to have ‘financial freedom’ which were the keywords that I googled in Feb 2009 and led me to an article talking about BTC.

Money is just a psychological thing we humans give value to and the root cause of many, many relationship problems. Money comes and goes. You cannot take it with you when you die. The real gold is what you really are and what you have in your heart. I would rather die poor and being known for doing good for the world rather than die being wealthy and lived a parasite selfish life.

o4a4ws,h2gmqpu,"It would be foolish to believe that an entity buying ""2-3 million"" bitcoin would not manipulate an unregulated marketed.

When dealing in financial markets it is best to believe that the market is an all-knowing all-capable adversary who does not act in your interests. Therefore, your statement should be phrased as ""if the US should print money and buy 2-3 million Bitcoin"" what would be the effect on the price? And the answer would ""depressive"" because selling 1/4 of those on exchanges would drive the price down and discourage purchasers of btc on the open market. 

The naivety of your premise is exposed by changing your statement to ""if <an entity> should ... buy 2-3 million Bitcoin"". BTC is a direct competitor to USD and for the next few years and we will deal with arbitrage of BTC/USD/EUR/etc. Bitcoin is not big enough to cope with this, so price volatility will be incredible. The FX market is huge. The inverse correlation of BTC and USD is already confirmation that a relationship exists to be manipulated. A large financial entity not taking advantage of this would be negligent IMO. So large arbitrage trades between USD->BTC->JPY (for example) should be expected. Such trading has already been profitable, so should be expected again.

Your premise also assumes US government is the only important entity. This is a common error. BTC/USD is best manipulated by entities outside the US, such as sheiks, russian oligarchs, etc. If we wanted to manipulate BTC to gain AED via USD it would be trivial if we had the capital. Even easier with USDT and other junk floating around the exchanges.

Once enough manipulators are into btc the arbitrage will level out and BTC total value will be larger than gold, hence the £1M USD price target.",9,2021-06-20 14:59:32,1624219172.0,Bitcoin

I was short £70K paying it all off, £40K came from BTC, the rest from ruthless savings over lockdowns.    


Spare me the bullrun bullshit, we've all been here before.  Over 5 years I've seen the runs and the crashes.  I need the money now to move house, I was not going to risk a crash.  


No, I won't buy back in, when you retire you want stability to your cash.  Much as though I love BTC and I've enjoyed the good bits of the ride, it's a roller coaster I don't want to stay on.

Sadly I would imagine that all the companies following his ""playbook"" are too.  Remember, always hold your own keys no matter how small (or large) of a bitcoin investor you are. People think their stacks are insignificant to making a difference but your) they're wrong. Can you imagine if everyone who had a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars actually took physical possession today?

Keep in mind CEOs making these calls have very different level of skin in the game than retail investors. I can bet the decision is signed off by Board and the accountability is diffused among a bunch of people who are very well compensated and their worst case is the market/board fires them and they retire rich. 

Retail investors don’t have that cushion so may be the cues should come from people like Novogratz who has gone all in or others of his ilk. I would not even rely on techies who hold a lot of Bitcoin as they are very emotionally tied to the asset class and will rather sink with it than accept that it can drop in value like any other asset.

Those who see it are redirected to @BTCvsFED on social media where a [thread](https://twitter.com/BTCvsFED/status/1346120210076483591) teaches them about Bitcoin as an alternative to our broken financial system.  

These were funded by selling prints of the artwork seen on the billboards.  

I worked with fellow artist [Josie Bellini](https://josie.io) to bring the artwork to life via augmented reality.  

Cheers!

lg7bqv,gmq85mk,"I’m not an expert on economics and I’m relatively new to Bitcoin.  But my understanding is that Bitcoin is considered either digital gold (i.e. an investment and hedge against inflation) or a currency in itself.  Sometimes both by the same people.

I understand the digital gold angle, although if that’s the case, I personally don’t see the intrinsic value of Bitcoin apart from easy of transfer.  Of course I personally don’t see any real non-industrial value to gold either, although most people disagree with me.

But if it’s supposed to be an actual currency, then my understanding is that you don’t want massive inflation with any currency, but you definitely don’t want deflation.  The goal is mild inflation constantly.  The reason for this is to spur investment in other real world parts of the economy, businesses, take risks, etc.  Otherwise, it would be more profitable to hold the currency (Bitcoin) than to actually invest it in economic pursuits, and you get economic recession.  I believe that this happened in Japan in the 90s-/2000 with their ‘lost decade’.  If that were the case, then would mass adoption of Bitcoin as a true common currency lead to it causing economic catastrophe, which would of course lead to it being banned and subsequently devalued.

I would expect that this would occur after massive adoption, but still, would occur?  Which to me makes it more of a speculative asset or inflationary hedge.  Am I missing something?",10,2021-02-09 12:58:25,1612897105.0,Bitcoin

qrxhnw,hk9q8c9,"Someone I know is a small business owner in Florida.  They told me about a program the state has where they use statistical analysis of sales tax income to accuse businesses of underpayment:  Based on your location, kind of business, and historical tax payments the state may accuse you of under paying sales tax-- not based on any actual evidence of underpayment.

The thing is that when they make the accusation they'll issue letters to your bank(s) freezing all your company and personal bank accounts, FIRST. You're given a choice: you can fight the false accusation and lose access to your accounts for months to years while you provide documentation to disprove their claims,  or you can just pay their requested settlement (extortion) fee and move on with your life.  If all your funds were in the bank accounts fighting may well mean losing your business or even your home, so even if you ultimately win, you lose.

Similar is true for federal criminal prosecution-- they often try to seize your accounts and make it difficult for your to afford a good defense.

Although we theoretically enjoy the broad protection under the law, the incestuous relationship between commercial banks and the government means that in practice we don't actually have due process protection much of the time.  The protection doesn't protect us against private entities, and the private entities have near monopolies and are under so much regulatory pressure that they'll go out of their way to do whatever they think the authorities want.  And unfortunately, no one is so boring that they don't have some risk of being hit by some automated bureaucratic screwup.

In these cases, owning some Bitcoin and keeping it in your own physical custody which can't be capriciously frozen without your cooperation can make the difference between being trampled on and being able to stand up for your rights and respond ""No, Fuck you!"" when some overpowered bureaucracy tries to extort you.",635,2021-11-11 18:16:46,1636676206.0,Bitcoin

No. Never. Ever.

As long as Satan can use his followers to recruit new ones, he will refrain from attacking them. These people are temporarily still useful to him. At some point, however, these followers will no longer bring new victims. That is when Satan will turn on his followers, eat their flesh, and drink their blood.

Satan has the God-given right to do that, because these people have signed away their souls to him. That is why we are not allowed to save these people. We must allow Satan to drag these people kicking and screaming to hell. Let them burn there for eternity.

qrxhnw,hkbnmdc,"Had this exact thing happen at a credit union of all places...because I moved $2500 from another bank to them.

They locked my account for a month until ""they"" knew where the money came from.

They said since I had never transferred money from another bank before they wanted to make sure everything was legit.

So I said that's fine, I understand, but an entire month? Smh...a month later I transfer another $1500 to that account from the same bank as I did a month before...same thing.

This time they said they needed to see bank statements from this other bank so they could see where it's coming from.

TF? they approved the bank when I connected it to them, which took 2 weeks, they approved my last transaction, even though they took a month to do so, and now they want bank statements?

I promptly went to that bank the next day, cashed out that account and closed it. Told the bank manager that had that been my primary bank what they did could have really put in a bad position and that I didn't appreciate all the run around I was given being that I was a customer and depositing a lot of money in their bank.

I'll never bank with them again and I tell everyone I know who even thinks of banking with them my experience, I had a similar experience with Bank Of America and PNC Bank...except with PNC I closed that account because their hours just didn't work for me...but then they send me a letter about 4 months or so after I closed my account saying I owed them about $200 because my account was overdrawn due to account fees.

Told them I closed that account months ago. They said that the account wasn't closed and that if I didn't pay it would be sent to collections.

I still had the letter I made the clerk print out when I closed my account. Went to the bank the next day I was off work, demanded to see the manager and showed them the letter.

Yeah...I didn't pay that dumb ass $200 fee. Later that day I came back with my mother who had been banking with them for years and she closed her account too.

Said she couldn't believe a bank would lie like that to someone.

I would get letters from them like every week about new accounts and bank statements, but as soon as I close me account I hear nothing from them until I owe them money.

If my account wasn't closed, why wasn't I receiving statements anymore, why could I no longer login to my account?

Hayek advocated for competing currencies, which is what crypto is giving us. Stablecoins are reinventions of bank issued currencies. Tether is treated as trading equal to the dollar, but in reality it's just fractional reserve banking recreated, with the currency ""backed"" by Bitfinex but not really. Presumably people know that if you hold Tether and there's a run on the currency with people selling it for dollars, you run the risk of not being able to redeem it.

I don't think this should be illegal, but this guy says fractional reserve banking is criminal. What seems bad is that you're forced to buy into a fractional reserve system since central bank policy doesn't check with you, but if you want to buy Tether, I think you should be able to.

It is true that taxation and money printing have similar effects on the general population. Essentially people are left with less purchasing power.

Leaving aside the particularities of each policy, it is often impossible to achieve the same objectives by using only one of them. For instance: how do you ""tax"" the rich progressively by printing money alone?

Many central banks have the sole purpose of keeping inflation within a manageable margin (FED is concerned with employment as well). It means that it should prevent excessive money supply in the economy, but also, it should pump enough money into the economy in order to prevent a deflation, which in not less dangerous than inflation.

As economics history tells us, in times like this, printing money is a necessity in order to compensate for the reduction in the velocity of money. Otherwise you may end up with money and not much left to buy.

It's terrible for poor people. It's terrible for political optics. Poltiicians aren't totally unaware of that. There is a reason almost none of them support flat taxes without refunds. Flat taxes without refunds are just bad for the majority of people, the only big pro of inflation as taxation is its ease and lack of collection mechanism needed.

m4edbf,gquarag,"Last year when I lost my job I was a bit less worried about it than I should be because I had been buying BTC the last couple years and as a millennial it’s really the first place I’ve ever seen that much of my money in one place and it’s honestly liberating. 

So instead of getting a new job right away, I’ve been able to freelance instead of working like a dog for someone else. I’ve limited my expenses as well, although I’m stuck in a NY lease so I’ve had to be pretty liberal with my credit card anyway. But I can do that, because I don’t plan on buying a home any time soon and don’t need a car and I’d rather keep steadily buying BTC. So chase has had to watch me prioritize buying BTC rather than pay them any more than the monthly minimum and people have all told me this was crazy. 

Yesterday Chase sends me an email saying that I’m pre-approved to refinance that same cc debt (it’s not a lot but also not nothing) and it was very satisfying because they are literally coming to me for once. 

Financial leverage is a powerful tool if you have the stomach for it. And while I don’t recommend handling your finances exactly the same as I have, I do recommend buying BTC as a wealth builder and using it as leverage rather than just hoping it goes up to sell it. The reality is that banks have been useless for years—they only sell debt products to the average person. BTC gains value over time because of its scarcity so long as people keep adopting it, and it can give us back the power of operating on our own terms and according to our own risk appetites. 

So if you’re thinking about buying some but are worried because your pessimistic friends or family heard some jaded financial advisor say it could go to zero, at the very least consider my story as to why it might make sense to buy a little anyway, just in case they’re wrong. It is a life raft and should be used as such.",6,2021-03-13 16:20:38,1615674038.0,Bitcoin

Hi, I am a Bitcoin OG, in Bitcoin since 2010. I want to give you a huge Kudos to you guys, you are killin it. You managed to do in few days what took Bitcoin years. Mainly to expose how our fiat system is completely broken and only serves the ones who controls the Wall Street with their printing press going brrrr.

I can see what your strategy with $GME is, however it has one major flaw. You are playing on their playground with their tokens. Therefore, as we have already seen, they can change the rules as they wish or simply lock you out of the playground entirely.

I am proposing you a coalition, alliance with us, Bitcoiners. We have a solution to your problem ready to be deployed. Once deployed on a large scale, there is now way back.

It wont be an easy path or quick way how to get rich. However if critical mass of people transfer their wealth into Bitcoin, the earth will start moving.

The final goal of Bitcoin is to bring back the sanity to the world of finance by serving as a global reserve asset and stop the fiat printing madness where few rich controls the printing presses and rob 99% of population thought the inflation. Bitcoin fixes this. There is and always be only 21.000.000 of Bitcoins. Full stop. If every member for WSB bought just 0.1BTC the world would be never the same. We need to take back ownership of our monetary system first and foremost. As long as they can print money, you can never win. In the end, they can easily inflate away all your gains on any stock, if they wish. They can ban your bank account or take money out of it. They simply own you. You cant win in casino if the casino itself owns the tokens you play with. Bitcoin fixesthis. You can make it happen tommorow if enough of you decide to to so.

Countrywide Mortgage screwed millions of us, the CEO took millions in a so called bonus and bounced out. Bank of America bought the defunct mortgage company and actually paid fines for Countryside’s illegal activities. 

When my bankruptcy was finalized in 13 I received mail from Bank of America stating I owed another payment. I called their bankruptcy department asking about the extra payment. I was told if I didn’t pay it, they threatened that there could be several more missed payments I will have to pay if I didn’t make the payment. I then refinanced my house to get out of the original loan and has been better since. I don’t trust a damn single bank, Wall Street, politician any more.

mbbj6h,gryb0fi,"Wow, this got a lot of attention and thank you for all the awards! I'm a teacher and one of my passions is financial education so I am now racked with guilt at the perhaps oversimplified format of this meme!
A couple of things:
- This meme format may not be original (which I thought was sort of the point of memes anyway) but I didn't knowingly copy it - I made it myself this morning. I'm sure memes with similar sentiments exist and that's great! The point of the meme is the important message. I've loved Mr Bean since my dad recorded it on VHS for me off the TV when I was in primary school. The stoicism that Mr Bean perfectly embodies in this scene (from the episode Mind the Baby, Mr Bean FYI) is the mindset that all long-term investors need, especially with volatile asset classes.
- Bitcoin is a great asset which I have a lot of confidence in but I keep it as a satellite investment with the core of my portfolio in passive index funds. It's certainly exciting and it seems to have low correlation with my other investments but you must diversify! Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose in anything! Budget properly, pay down debt, keep an emergency fund, get life insurance etc.",2,2021-03-23 12:40:49,1616521249.0,Bitcoin

Tons of people don't understand it, because for old school people, it's difficult to understand. Some people in Bitcoin are more  than just monetarily invested in Bitcoin, and they need to lose this childish us against them mentality. There are actual intellectual barriers to Bitcoin and the technological learning curve is also steep. I wouldn't expect my dad to take it on, let alone my grandpa.

Besides, the entire culture around Bitcoin reeks of a *get-rich-quick scheme* and responsible old school people looking after their family patrimony/retirement funds/college funds/trust funds are right to be cautious and spend their valuable time operating where they have experience. Your gramps doesn't want do something that feels/looks a lot like playing with fire, and you should value that about him. He probably wouldn't be where he is today if he was prone to playing with fire, which indirectly kind of means you wouldn't either.

Some machines you can withdraw cash in it... when withdrawing cash you get the options to withdraw
 "" SMALL , LARGE AMOUNTS OF FIAT MONEY ""

SMALL = 1 CAD TO 9,999 CAD 
LARGE = 10,000 CAD TO 25,000 CAD

SOME MACHINE WITH BUY/SELL OPTIONS EVEN LETS YOU WITHDRAW UP TO 100K CAD I THINK.

These machine let's you stay bankless or let's you not to resort on bank as little as you can. 

THE MOST IVE LIQUIDATED BTC FROM MY BTC MOBILE  WALLET INTO STRAIGHT CASH USING ONE OF THESE MACHINES WAS DURING THE WORST DAYS OF PANDEMICS...
I NEEDED CASH AND THE CLOSEST BANK HAD A LONG LINE UP. 

INTEAD I WENT TO THE STORE CLOSE TO MY OLD PLACE WHICH HAD ONE OF THESE MACHINES AND SOLD BTC AND I WAS ABLE TO CASH OUT/WITHDRAW ALMOST $15,000 CANADIAN. 

before that though I went back home and imported my mnemonic words into my cellphone btc wallet.
One of my wallet I remembered had a little over 4BTC at the time... which I imported into my cellphone and from there I went out and went to this to cash out some of it...
I now own 9 trezor/ledger wallets and some devices that has hot wallets with crypto and BTC INSIDE WHICH I DONT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET UNLESS I NEED TOO..


If you think these things are useless then you are not at a  level yet where you know you can't trust institutions banks and etc for your wealth....

The Fed is an independent government agency that is responsible for implementing monetary policy in the United States, and it is required to adhere to strict financial management practices.  
  
The Fed is audited annually by an independent external audit firm, and the results of these audits are reported to Congress. The Fed's financial statements are also reviewed by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which is an independent agency that audits federal programs and activities.  
  
In addition to these audits, the Fed is also subject to oversight by other federal agencies, such as the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and the Congressional Oversight Panel (COP). The OIG is responsible for conducting investigations and audits of the Fed's programs and activities, and the COP is an independent panel that is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

eq2eza,fepi8t5,"I'm no economics expert, but I can at least look at statistics with a fair bit of confidence. With that said, what point exactly are you trying to put across with this? This is all relativistic, and when you look at the numbers it starts to really not make a difference in the spending power of your dollar today.

Things to consider:

1. The federal minimum wage in 1970 was around $1.60/hr. It is now $7.25/hr, with a a large majority of states, localities and even companies raising their minimum wages up to anywhere between $10-$15/hr in 2019-2020. That means an 8 hour work day in 1970 would get you $12.80 pre-tax, where today an 8 hour work day gets you between $80-$120.


2. The cost of a large fry (according to your picture) in 1970 was $0.26, adjusted for inflation, the cost today would be $1.71. If you look up the average cost of a large fry at McDonalds today in 2020, it's about $1.89 (depending on location).

These two things considered, in 1970, if you had worked a minimum wage job for one 8 day you could purchase 49 large fries. Today after an 8 hour work day working for $12 (for simplicities sake, I'm just using a rough median here), you could buy yourself about 50 large fries.

So nothing much has changed. Your dollar hasn't really devalued in the practical sense. In fact, your spending power has gone up by a small degree if we're just talking about the economy of fried potatoes. With other commodities, the spending power of a dollar has risen substantially more because the prices of certain goods (like motor vehicles, electronics, and other technology) have fallen dramatically over the years.

My point is that context is crucial when you're talking about economics and the change in the spending power of your money over a period of time.",3,2020-01-17 22:19:36,1579321176.0,Bitcoin

https://news.yahoo.com/china-bitcoin-crackdown-trillion-dollar-103308054.html
> 
> Michael Saylor, CEO and founder of MicroStrategy has criticized China’s ongoing action against Bitcoin (BTC), saying it will prove to be “a trillion-dollar mistake.”
> 
> Appearing on Bloomberg Technology, the entrepreneur told Emily Chang, “China had 50% market share of bitcoin and they were generating $10 billion a year, in a business that was growing 100% a year, year-over-year.”
> 
> He went on to opine that the Chinese government’s crackdown has “squeezed the [bitcoin] industry out of China.”
> 
> Mr Saylor also said that this action is a tragedy for Chinese miners. Over the last few weeks, the crackdown forced miners to move their operations overseas, with the United States proving a popular destination. More specifically Texas, due to their cheap energy prices and pro-crypto government. Reports indicate that Bitmain, Blockcap, Argo Blockchain, and Great American Mining are rumored to have moved their operations there.
> 
> In addition, Francis Suarez, Mayor of Miami, said earlier in the month that his city would welcome the displaced miners. 
> 
> MicroStrategy increases BTC holdings
> Emily Chang also dedicated part of her interview with Saylor to discuss the current BTC dip. On June 21, MicroStrategy added a further 13,005 BTC to its already considerable holding, which now totals at over 100,000 BTC. Valued in excess of $3 billion. 
> 
> Asserting that the CEO had “bought the dip”, Ms Chang then asked if he had considered the possibility that the dip was actually “part of a prolonged slide.”
> 
> Mr Saylor answered that China’s “rushed exodus of capital and mining” is currently driving the crypto market dynamic.
> 
> He went on to refer to his company’s own strategy as “long-term” and assessed that BTC is for property what the iPhone is for music. 
> 
> “Bitcoin is the dematerialization of property,” he explained. “We’re sucking the value out of gold and real estate and other property assets and collectibles and art. We’re putting it on a blockchain, we’re giving it to the people. It’s a long-term trend; it’s a million times more efficient than hauling your property around on your back.”
> 
> The CEO later took to Twitter to reiterate some main points from his interview. In one tweet, he said “If you want to give joy to 5 billion people, you need digital music. If you want to give knowledge to 5 billion people, you need digital books. If you want to give wealth to 5 billion people, you need digital property.”",119,2021-06-30 12:59:36,1625075976.0,Bitcoin

This forces every custodial service to act as a panopticon and watch and report every transaction you make. Which is obviously bad enough. But this is law also talks about miners, software wallet makers, hardware wallet makers, and DEXs needing to report their users transactions. It’s literally impossible to comply with this. It would be the equivalent of buying a leather wallet from Walmart but the manufacturer of the wallet needs to keep track of all your payments with cash that you keep in the wallet. It’s unenforceable for any tech that’s not custodial. And the problem with that is that they then can arbitrarily enforce it and shut down any registered company in the US that isn’t complying with their ‘rules.’ If you excuse this cause ‘crypto needs regulation’ then go fuck yourself.

nz12yr,h1n5s3b,"There is a lot of misconception about this crash. First thing this crash was architectured by someone who hacked into a major account on Mt Gox. The plan was to withdraw max BTC with the 1000$ withdrawal limit on Mt. Gox. The easiest way to do that was to crash the price by selling some portion of BTC @ 0.01$. That way @ 0.01$/BTC the Hacker could withdraw 100,000 BTC. 

However, there was also a limit on the number of BTC that could be withdrawn. This the hackers overlooked and couldn't get away with the master plan. Eventually all the trades executed during this flash crash were undone. So, even if you had bought the absolute bottom you still wouldn't have got to keep your bought BTCs.

I exclude from this ""low value"" commodities like Soybeans and,  yes, crude oil (which may be staggeringly important, but inherently carries a low value)

Gold is \*almost\* as bad as precious gems, which are hilariously laughably bad in this regard (with the exception of diamond, all precious gems are oxides of \*aluminum\* and \*silicon\* and both of these minerals are the predominant constituents of dirt and sand, and literally \*ALL\* of them can be grown in macroscopically large high perfection single crystals, ingots, or boules)

Gold has fractional industrial value, and while it is a rare metal/mineral (sometimes called a ""rare earth"") its by no means ""rare"" for any real purposes and can readily be extracted from the ground globally.

The ""most real"" are the catalytic metals like Rhodium, Palladium, Rhenium, Zirconium, etc.

Even better are the metals that basically NO ONE cares about from a belief standpoint, like Neodymium, Hafnium, etc. which have well known and extremely important industrial uses and are WAYYY rarer than gold (as much as 10x rarer)

Utter nonsense logic!

>I never want to hear people say ""I wish I would've bought Bitcoin at X Price"".....because these are the people that would INSTANTLY SELL the second Bitcoin had a 30% or higher correction!

Why are you assuming the dumbest from people? I know nobody fitting this description but two people who are quite the opposite. Both of them successively bought bitcoins between $2 and $100. They sold between 20% and 60% of it for a better living, as needed (incl. buying real estate, quitting job), and hodled the rest until the present day. They hodled trough the bear market 2014/2015 and hodled through the bear market 2018/2019. So they do not match your prejudice at all. They do not regret selling, because they could measurably improve their living standards.

YET, they say ""I wish I would have bought when Bitcoin was at $1, then I would have not only Millions but tens of Millions today.""

So you should not generalize so strongly.",12,2021-05-18 03:12:59,1621325579.0,Bitcoin

n14suf,gwb1aje,"> The first part of the quotation (""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered"") has not been found anywhere in Thomas Jefferson's writings, to Albert Gallatin or otherwise. It is identified in Respectfully Quoted as spurious, and the editor further points out that the words ""inflation"" and ""deflation"" are not documented until after Jefferson's lifetime.2

>  The second part of the quotation (""I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies"") is a slight misquotation of a statement Jefferson made in a letter to John Taylor in 1816. He wrote, ""And I sincerely believe with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; & that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale""3

> The third part of this quotation (""The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs"") may be a misquotation of Jefferson's comment to John Wayles Eppes in 1813, ""Bank-paper must be suppressed, and the circulating medium must be restored to the nation to whom it belongs.""4

There's no way to tell if we've hit rock bottom so don't try to predict anything. Just be happy at whatever price you entered into. In theory, if you stretch your ""investment"" horizon to 5 or 10 years or more, all this timing nonsense would be irrelevant. Timing the equity market is already a bad move where it's much more predictable in the long run, so why are you doing it now in a purely speculative market?

Unless you're an active trader, and if you are, you wouldn't even be here in the first place.

lx4svz,gpnu0zu,"You are 100% right in your core analysis, but there are a number of problems: 

\- after the Mt Gox fiasco, it was discovered Karpelès had created thousand of fake wallets. Wells Fargo created thousands of fake accounts. We do not have assurance the wallet or address numbers represent real people. There has long been suspicion that exchanges exaggerate volumes, numbers of clients, even crypto holdings. Worse, Karpelès was shown to have created ‘Willy & Markus‘ bots that bid for BTC on an automated basis, inflating the price. Of course this has now stopped?   


\- Bitcoin whales having very large numbers of coins have decreased. Only one - presumably Satoshi, remains. This could be because the largest whales sold off, but more likely the largest whales split the stash into several smaller wallets. Seen a really great graphic on this showing the number of huge bubbles of BTC decreasing whilst smaller bubbles emerge. Wish I had kept the link to that. It was done through exchanges, the suspicion being to create the impression of lots of BTC being traded, whereas they were just being moved around.   


\-Tether is an obvious fraud and the NYAG straight up says so. Tether supplies the vast majority of all crypto liquidity, so you are exposed to it whether you know it, deal in it or not.   


\- Proof of work is environmental vandalism.  Which will get worse as price of BTC rises.   


\- Look carefully at the history of people promoting ‘institutional adoption’ of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor has form with the SEC for fraud. Elon Musk is a serial charlatan. Barry Silbert created the GBTC, described as a ‘reflexive Ponzi’.

Also I make good money selling the spots for other people to sell and I going to this every month and I’m sure I will sell more spots for the next one. 

About the “The Dark Knight Returns”
It’s not useless, but I already read it and I’m keeping another comics that are most likely I will want to re-read in the future. I much prefer that someone else have the opportunity to read it for first time than have to clean the dust from time to time, and I feel the same with videogames. At the end of the day it was difficult to sell it because it’s in english, hope to sell it next month you don’t find this stuff in the stores in my area.

About the “F40”
If I don’t sell it my 4 year old will beak it, she already broke a Dogde Viper, a Ferrari 455GT, and a beautiful Ferrari GTB4 that was red is now blue. I let her keep a Porsche Carrera and a Corvette C5 that still are in good shape. Yesterday I sold the “F50” to a lady that have not clue what was buying, that hurt a little.

I personally buy a bit of crypto monthly (not a lot, only 2% of my portfolio and I don't yolo), but I use bisq rather than centralized exchanges so the fees make it difficult right now. Will buy more once fees are low again. Speculators can say what they want, but their virtual market maker run casinos aren't the ones pushing demand. OTC buying, decentralized buying and the black market are the ones mainly influencing supply and demand.

Not to mention miners still need to pay monthly operating costs and they will gladly sell at 0% profit margin this month if they know the next 12 months are going to be back to normal.

Same thing happened with oil at the start of the pandemic for instance. You could be speculating on oil ""exposure"" all you want, but once the underlying buyers realized they had excessive amounts of barrels in reserve they stopped buying or decreased buying for a few months and cfd/options speculators got crushed. All the exchanges that don't allow withdrawals or investment apps that offer crypto ""exposure"" are the same as cfds/options.

The pandemic has super charged online payments and internet commerce. For business owners (and customers too) paying with traditional credit cards is a massive expense.

My in-law for example own a retail shop. Their second largest expense after rent is merchant fees. $1k or more every month sucked out of their profits and paid to visa and mc for nothing more than being able to conduct business. No other value added. It feels like paying the mafia for protection money. They get a cut for doing nothing, add no value and you make less profit - plus pass the cost onto customers too.

On top of that they have to pay various other fees and even a few to rent the credit card terminal.

It’s archaic.

Sending money from one person to another shouldn’t cost 3-4% just because it’s electronic. 

I’ve always believed one day something would disrupt this ridiculous never ending series of credit card and bank fees...and am so excited it’s finally gonna start happening.

Why would merchants pay 3-4% of their profits to credit card companies, then wait 2-3 days for the money to arrive in their bank, when they could do it for next to nothing and get the funds immediately?

ep2qsb,fejk5vk,"Banking sector is a atomic bunker today.  


The three biggest problems with banking today:  


1. **Deposit guarantee scheme provided by government**, that is taxpayers. Remember the bailouts? And if any bank actually collapses then the legal burden to compensate deposit holders is on taxpayers. That is bank takes a risk at the expense of taxpayers. There is no other branch of industry that enjoys such privilege.
2. **Fractional reserve banking** \- lending the same money multiple times, up 30 times currently depending on what the reserve interests rates are. Again, this is banks taking risks while taxpayers are insurers of the whole business.
3. **Minimum required capital to start one's own bank -** in Europe it is 5m Euro  and similar amounts in other countries.  That stops overwhelming majority of people from entering the banking sector. The hardest industry to get into where despite the actual costs being one of the smallest across multiple industries, the statutory minimum required capital of 5m Euro makes it borderline impossible for any entrepreneur to start their own bank.",2,2020-01-16 06:26:26,1579177586.0,Bitcoin

SBF was a tool. He's probably (knowingly or unknowingly) part of deep state psyops false flag to try to discredit crypto (INCLUDING BITCOIN), and ensure that there was enough public outrage in order to finally regulate crypto (INCLUDING BITCOIN) into the dust.

But regardless, and all conspiracy theories aside....the state is not your friend. SBF has little or nothing to do with bitcoin or even most crypto projects and their decentralized and anti-state nature. Cheering on the demise of fraudsters like SBF is one thing, but all of this ire is directed at trying to discredit elements of the crypto ecosystem which will eventually drag bitcoin down with it.

Governments already have stifled bitcoin massively with existing regulations and tax classifications...you can bluster all you want that governments can't kill bitcoin, but evidence so far suggests that they can, at least to the extent that the masses can never use it and avail themselves of its benefits.

The state is the enemy here and always has been, and has been the bane of bitcoin flourishing and stability from the start.  SBF is irrelevant except as a tool of the state to codify bad laws and regulations, which will persist long after negative public perceptions of bitcoin due to SBF's actions fade away.",4,2022-12-13 12:06:36,1670954796.0,Bitcoin

As time goes and the price of Bitcoin continues to rise, it would cost you less and less Bitcoin to make those $800 payments each month.

Those who make a bad decision and come out with a bad outcome (like this guy) will tell people they were scammed or the system is rigged.

In investing there are two ways to lose money:

1. You are unlucky to invest at a time where the market keeps dropping for years/decades and there's nothing you can do.
This is possible but very unlikely.

2. You suck at investing and in fact you are not Warren Buffett.

Some people stamp it onto metal.

Simpler: Create two handwritten copies on decent paper with pencil. Don't use a computer printer, your seed phrase could become compromised. Don't write it with ink, it might fade but pencil will not.

Double, then triple check the copies for accuracy. Remember, your life savings are at stake.

Store each copy to protect it from moisture and/or paper-eating insects, mold, etc. For example, ziploc baggies, small plastic bottles, pvc sprinkler tubing capped at the ends.

Store the copies in separate locations in case of fire, flood, etc. Think long and hard about really, really good hiding locations.

A home safe is a bad location. During a potential home invasion robbery, they will aim a gun at your head and force you to open your safe -- make sure your seed phrase is not inside.

Similarly, so-called ""safe deposit boxes"" are not all that secure. Bad places for seed phrases.

Better places might include a gap behind some dry wall which has then been patched and repainted.

In addition to having written copies in separate locations, memorize your seed phrase and quietly rehearse it at least once per day, ideally in the bathroom with the door shut, the fan running, and the water running (and no phones, cameras, or other microphoned devices nearby).",8,2022-11-17 10:35:47,1668702947.0,Bitcoin

np4tfx,h03tq0m,"WTF it was never banned, in 2018 RBI the central bank of india had asked banks to cut all ties with entites dealing in crypto, even then Indian exchanges were operating on basis of peer to peer transfer since banks weren't directly interacting with exchanges in this scenario. In 2020 Supreme Court of India set aside this circular by RBI, mainly for n the basis that such an action i.e. suppressing of crypto was out of jurisdiction of RBI, hinting was the job of government. In 2019 government had formed an panel for action to be taken on cryptocurrencies in India. This panel called for a complete ban and harsh punishment for anyone holding it. While government didn't take any action on the recommendations of this panel. This year government had planned to bring in a new legislation on cryptocurrencies in Feb-March session. Accordingly to leaks and rumours it was going to implement the recommendations of the panel from 2019 i.e. complete ban. But for some reasons (probably due to less priority) the bill was not discussed in this session. Now country is in midst of raging second wave of covid pandemic, hence chances are less of any new legislation is short foreseeable future. Many reports suggests that lobbies with stake in crypto are trying to convince government into bringing positive regulations, but nobody knows what government will do. My 2 cents are there are more chances that government moght still ban it. From what I have seen current government makes hasty decisions and has tight curbs on money laundering and other illegal monetary pratices hence more reason to think government will see this cryptocurrencies in negative light. Again government loves to follow in China's footsteps. So I would say there is 60-70% chances that government might ban cryptocurrencies in near future.
P.S. if government bans crypto, in due time it will have to lift it none the less because we all know crypto os the future.",3,2021-05-31 13:11:58,1622484718.0,Bitcoin

If the pandemic has taught employers and employees anything, at least in the majority of jobs that only require a laptop and a network connection, it's that the job can get done remotely. 100% remotely, with or without the virus and its mandates. If you're not in such a field, I'd look into it, because it's absolutely worth it. I used to miss the office setting and loathe another day at the house, but the freedoms it has afforded me make me want to brag like OP.

I'm just here to say it's possible to not be retired and still do the things you love.

So far I got enough investments to hopefully pull off a semi-retirement this year if Bitcoin moons. If not, I’ll keep stacking until 2025 and hopefully I’ll be in full retirement by then. 

Since you were mining crypto early on, I’m assuming you knew about the halvings and the cycles. If you could do it all over again, would you cash out less Bitcoin in 2017 and hold more for this cycle? 

I’m thinking of my exit strategy and considering between cashing out enough to live off of and hodl the rest until the next cycle or cash out majority and live off of dividends like yourself.",7,2021-01-10 02:54:37,1610268877.0,Bitcoin

Buying the miner vs buying a heating system

Monthly expenditure to keep your house warm

For the miner:  Mining earnings - Electricity.

For the heater:  0 - Natural Gas or Electricity 

(note the heat pumps are 30% more efficient than joule-based heaters)

**3 - Noise**

This depends on the design of the miner, There are silent but still efficient heat transfer methods

The standard heaters (natural gas / heat pumps) are also noisy.

**4 - Maintainability**

After a few iterations the miner (solid state) will be easier to maintain than a freaking heater with moving parts.

**5 - Convexity of the investment**

The heater will never give you profits, with the miner you at least have the possibility of high earnings.

I bought back in 2018 when Bitcoin got popular amongst the mainstream media and my friend groups. When that 20k figure plummeted, I felt so stupid and that maybe I bought into a false dream. After seeing Bitcoin reach the numbers that it did last week, I realized that the Bitcoin game is volatile and that's why we have to be in it for the long haul.

kvr8n3,gj0hiwu,"This is indeed what I've been telling friends asking about cryptocurrency investments. 

This feels so similar to 2017/early 2018. 
The reality is that no one knows anything. 

People coming with all kinds of fancy analytics and buzzwords that the kaiju line is entering 4th quadrant or whatever else nonsense. No one has a clue except supply and demand, on a very volatile and obscure market. 

In early 2018, made the mistake to wait too long to sell and take profits without being greedy. Not this time. 

My group has collectively sold 90% of our respective portfolios over the weekend and today.  Not a huge amount, but roughly 4x/5x the initial investment from early 2017 and it's good enough. 

Is it going to go crazily up in the short term ? Who knows. 
I didn't want to get burned a second time around and miss the opportunity for taking nice profits and stop looking at the charts every day recently. Assets can go down 30%+ in a matter of hours and even limit / stop orders which not many people use aren't perfect.

Potential to raise higher in several years ? Probably. But most likely with another set of huge corrections in between in the near future. If that happens, might be time to re-enter the market and wait for another run. 

But really nobody knows and anybody that believes otherwise is fooling themselves or more importantly others.

I don't really get the ""hodl til death"" or ""weak hands"" mentality. 

Of course this should be money you don't need, but even then taking profits when it's up 400% or more can be a sane choice. 

This isn't amazon, google, tesla stock etc. This is a very volatile market driven a lot by hype, regardless of the tech.

For example, do you want to own x amount of BTC? Then DCA every month/week until you reach your goal. Do you want x% of your portfolio to be in BTC? Then buy BTC now (or DCA) and rebalance as necessary. Are you a trader? Then learn some technical analysis and stick to your plans.

Bitcoin has seen, and is seeing significant institutional adoption as well as adoption from hedge funds, billionaires (Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Drunkenmiller, Mike Novotratz etc) and this has changed the paradigm. Comparing Bitcoin to the past is a pointless exercise. 

Also there is no mention of the endless QE which is inflating assets immensely, and the risk of holding cash right now is high as its value is being debased. Bitcoin is the best asset one can hold to protect themselves. Volatility is the price you pay for performance.

lol that ""kid"" is like a career mil officer pushing 40.

So before this post turns viral, some important context on what's going on here: a technical branch (which the air force is) is sending a well performing officer to grad school to study whatever vaguely suits them and vaguely supports the DoD mission (which MIT/bitcoin is in both cases here). This is a norm, full stop. Using his research as a clear indication that the DoD is on its way to using crypto in the same way it ended up GPS is nonsensical unfortunately. Using his research as an indicator that Space Force/DoD needs are anywhere near hosted/supported by the btc ledger isalso nonsensical.

To put it another way, if this guy/kid gets you all fired up for DoD<>Bitcoin<>White House rumors, wait until you discover DARPA, Naval Post Grad School (Monterey, CA), and Johns Hopkins (Baltimore, MD) research directions.

edit-  lol post went viral indeed I guess. friendly reminder to do some research before you \~dox someone like this, this sort of publicity has negative blowback on the officer and their career. I don't think that publicity would have occurred if this was properly understood (or bothered to be researched) as ""there's a military officer at grad school studying an interesting topic which implies nothing more than the DoD values intellectual diversity, in the same way that the military officers sent to harvard business doesn't imply the DoD is considering integrating investment banking as a new feature of the military, or that pete buttigieg's career doesn't imply the Navy has plants in McKinsey and the presidential staff."" this subreddit is a mess lately.",79,2021-12-08 14:10:24,1638994224.0,Bitcoin

There are lots of projects that address this class of problem.  There's three aspects to the solution: 

  1. Hash the thing.  
  2. Archive the thing.  
  3. Timestamp the thing.

The hash needs to be stored somewhere (ideally in a Merkle tree of some sort). The next problem is to archive the thing.  But then there's the problem of **when** that hash happened.  Do I trust you?  A company?  A government?  One of the best uses for blockchains is using them as trusted timestamper of hashes.

On November 12, 2021, Yoon indicated that he would be open to more US THAAD missile deployments in South Korea.[73]
On November 30, 2021, Yoon said he would abolish the 52-hour workweek and the minimum wage if he became president.[74]
On January 7, 2022, he wrote on his Facebook page, ""Abolish the Ministry of Women and Family"". The post received a good response from Idaenam, while feminist organizations criticized it as ""hate politics"".[75][76] He has been labelled as an avowed ""anti-feminist"" and said that South Korean women do not suffer systemic discrimination.[77]""

l2pu42,gk81bfw,">Wright is known for his long list of academic qualifications and love of acquiring more. He referred, for instance, to an [essay](https://coingeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CraigWright_An-Un-lyrical-Ode-to-the-Bard.pdf) he wrote as part of a Masters in English Literature, about one of Shakespeare’s sonnets in which he speculates about the poem’s relation to Elizabeth I and contemporary historical events. In a previous interview he said he was taking 25 degree courses simultaneously. Now he says he’s finished some of those, but that last year he read 2,400 books. That works out at an average of six and a half per day. Asked how that’s possible, he says, “I read very fast” and “some books are smaller than others”. It seems he is producing information as prolifically as he absorbs it: he says that Grammarly tells him he wrote almost 3 million words in the 12 months to February.

This is an excerpt from an actual Coingeek article. I don't know how anyone even takes this guy seriously. Literally the funniest thing I've ever read.

lqe3l6,gogvrju,"Want a sad story?

In 2009, when Bitcoin was less than $0.01/BTC, a friend of mine gave me $20 worth of BTC for my 19th birthday in June. 

He told me to hang onto it and it would be worth a lot of money one day. He tried explaining it to me in ways that sounded crazy, using phrases like:

- Universal currency. 
- Money of the future. 
- Completely digital source of income. 

Just stuff like that. 

I didn’t take it seriously, so 6 months later, in December... My 2 year anniversary with the girl I had been dating was coming up. I felt like doing something special, but I was jobless at that time. So I sold all 2130 shares of my Bitcoin for a profit of $1.67. 

With $21.67 in hand, I went to the store, bought the ingredients for her favorite meal, bought some flowers, and went to her place to get cooking. 

It was a really nice dinner. Totally crushed it. She was smiling through every bite. We talked, we laughed, we had a good time. She complimented the meal, and then dumped me as I was clearing the table. 

... Yeah... It came out of nowhere for me too. 

I didn’t give it much thought until December 2017, when Bitcoin came up in my new circle of friends. It was at $19,000 per BTC. They were all talking about how they had missed their chance to get in on it, and I just started thinking back to my birthday in 2009, and what that friend said, and how I had thought it sounded crazy. 

But what was really crazy is that I got dumped ON my 2 year anniversary, AFTER I had cooked that girl a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo that, adjusting for the modern BTC price, would be worth $40,470,000 dollars in December of 2017.

A few days ago, that Fettuccine Alfredo was worth $125,670,000. 

I tried looking up the friend who gifted it to me. We had lost touch after I moved out of state. All of his social media had been deactivated, but I was still friends with his sister on Facebook and Instagram.

Through some of her posts, I found out her brother (my old friend) had paid off his parents house, bought his sister a house, bought himself a house, sent his sisters to college, bought everyone in his immediate family new cars, and then stopped spending. 

The houses aren’t huge. He’s living very modestly for how much money he has. He just wanted to set up his family with all they needed and then be comfortable forever. 

I know for a fact he has an obscene amount of BTC left, or cashed it out for a ridiculous amount of money, because when he gave me my $20 worth, he told me that he had invested all $8000 of his savings into BTC. 

If $20 would have been worth $125million... His $8000 would be worth TENS OF BILLIONS (depending on when he sold).

Aaaand that could have been me as well.

It’s almost what you would expect decentralization to force onto the centralized world. They will only conform to us when they are forced to. Mr. Powell’s comments sound like a person that knows who he’s speaking to when he openly advocates for the removal of assets from the exchange he represents.

I believe things will be looking much better by summer and into autumn, but my real targets are 2025, 2029, and 2033.  I always aim for the year after a halving.

My only gripe about the drop in Bitcoin's price is that I've already put in all I can until my next paycheck.  Will this price hold for two more weeks (12 days, actually)?  I doubt it, but I hope it does because I want to buy more!  If the price stays below $34K for 12 more days, I'll be able to hit my goal for the entire year by June 4th.  If not, it'll take me another month or two depending on how high it climbs.  Sigh.

u2bfgl,i4hveza,"New York Post headline:
> Bitcoin fans are psychopaths who don’t care about anyone, study shows 

The actual text: 
> If you’re a crypto fan yourself, don’t fear – investing doesn’t suddenly make you evil.

> “We studied **only a subset** of people interested in crypto who do have these traits,” Dr. Wang said.

> “If you happen to be a Bitcoin or other crypto holder, you may or may not exhibit them.”

The links:

> The link between the traits and an affinity for Bitcoin is also driven by the fact that the currency does not have a central authority, meaning it is separate from banks and governments.

> Machiavellians – who are good at deception and take a calculated approach to achieving goals – like crypto “primarily because they distrust politicians and government agencies”, Dr. Wang said.

> He added: “Many crypto supporters believe governments are corrupt, and crypto avoids government corruption.”

> Narcissists, on the other hand, are drawn to the technology because they tend to focus on the positive side of life.

> The researchers found that narcissists like crypto because of their great faith in the future and confidence that their own lives will improve.

> Lastly, impulsive psychopaths and sadists like crypto because they are thrill-seekers who fear missing out on the rewards of investing.

> “To them, perhaps both the pleasure from seeing another’s pain and the fear of missing out are related to selfishness,” Dr. Wang wrote.

I don't want to say that Bitcoin is dead, it's not, it is actively developed with the largest capital, but I think that the smarter blockchains will mature over time and become even more popular. Projects runnig on them are rather independent on blockchain runnig on it, as well as Bitcoin itself (it can be fully tokenized as well). Saying that Bitcoin is only true cryptocurrency is like being stuck in 20th century. Like with BBS or ARPA net, we will newer forget, but we need to go further. If it can hit $1M?

Well, Brad Sherman was voted by his peers as the #1 meanest male in all of the D.C. House by his peers.

VOTE SHERMAN OUT!!  This should be bi-partisan and have nothing to do with political party.
